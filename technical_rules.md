# Technical Rules for Novel Writing

## Novel Structure

### Three-Act Structure
- **Act 1 (25%)**: Setup, introduces characters, setting, and central conflict
  - Inciting incident occurs around 10-15% mark
  - First plot point/threshold crossing ends Act 1
- **Act 2 (50%)**: Confrontation, rising action, complications
  - Midpoint occurs halfway through (shifts from reaction to action)
  - Second plot point occurs around 75% mark
- **Act 3 (25%)**: Resolution, climax, denouement
  - Climax occurs around 90% mark
  - Final 10% resolves remaining threads

### The Hero's Journey
1. **Ordinary World**: Character's normal life before adventure
2. **Call to Adventure**: Presentation of challenge or problem
3. **Refusal of the Call**: Reluctance to change
4. **Meeting the Mentor**: Acquiring guidance
5. **Crossing the Threshold**: Committing to the journey
6. **Tests, Allies, Enemies**: Facing challenges, building relationships

9. **Reward**: Achieving goal but with consequences
10. **The Road Back**: Consequences of actions
11. **Resurrection**: Final test of character
12. **Return with Elixir**: Character returns transformed

### Save the Cat Structure

3. **Setup**: Establish protagonist's world
4. **Catalyst**: Inciting incident
5. **Debate**: Protagonist hesitates
6. **Break into Two**: Protagonist enters adventure
7. **B Story**: Secondary plot/relationship begins
8. **Fun and Games**: "Promise of the premise"
9. **Midpoint**: Raises stakes, false victory/defeat
10. **Bad Guys Close In**: Complications intensify
11. **All Is Lost**: Protagonist's lowest point
12. **Dark Night of the Soul**: Internal crisis
13. **Break into Three**: Protagonist finds solution
14. **Finale**: Resolution of conflict
15. **Final Image**: Demonstrates transformation

## Point of View (POV)

### First-Person POV
- Narrated using "I/we" pronouns
- Limited to protagonist's direct experiences and thoughts
- Creates intimacy but limits narration to what the character knows
- Ideal for character-driven stories

**Rules:**
- Cannot narrate scenes where the character isn't present
- All observations filtered through narrator's perceptions
- Can be unreliable (reader may question narrator's perception)

### Third-Person Limited
- Uses "he/she/they" pronouns
- Focuses on thoughts/feelings of one character at a time
- Can switch between characters (with clear breaks)
- Offers more flexibility than first-person

**Rules:**
- Maintain consistent distance from character
- Avoid head-hopping (switching POVs within scenes)
- Language should reflect the focal character's vocabulary/worldview

### Third-Person Omniscient
- Narrator knows and sees all
- Can reveal thoughts of multiple characters
- Provides broader perspective on events

**Rules:**
- Establish clear narrative voice separate from characters
- Avoid confusing readers about whose perspective is being shown
- Be judicious with revealing character thoughts

### Second-Person POV
- Uses "you" pronoun, placing reader in protagonist role
- Creates unique immediacy but can feel gimmicky
- Best used for specific stylistic effects

## Tense

### Past Tense
- Most common in fiction (e.g., "She walked to the store")
- Creates sense of events having already occurred
- Feels natural to most readers

**Rules:**
- Maintain consistency throughout narrative
- Use past perfect ("had walked") for events before the main timeline

### Present Tense
- Creates immediacy and urgency (e.g., "She walks to the store")
- Common in YA and contemporary fiction
- Can feel more intimate and immediate

**Rules:**
- Difficult to sustain for long narratives
- Use present perfect ("has walked") for events before the main timeline
- Avoid accidentally slipping into past tense

## Pacing Techniques

### Sentence Length
- Short sentences speed pace
- Long, complex sentences slow pace
- Vary sentence length for rhythm

### Scene vs. Summary
- Scenes: Show real-time action (slows pace, increases tension)
- Summary: Condenses time (speeds pace, covers necessary information)
- Balance based on narrative importance

### Exposition Control
- Integrate exposition during action
- Break up information blocks
- Deliver information just before it's needed

### Transitional Devices
- Chapter breaks at high-tension moments
- Section breaks to indicate time/location shifts
- White space to imply passage of time

## Grammar & Syntax

### Paragraphing
- New paragraph for new speaker
- New paragraph for new location/time
- New paragraph for emphasis or pacing
- Shorter paragraphs increase pace

### Common Errors
- Comma splices: Joining independent clauses with commas
- Run-on sentences: Independent clauses without proper punctuation
- Subject-verb agreement: Especially with collective nouns
- Dangling modifiers: Unclear what's being modified

### Active vs. Passive Voice
- Active voice: Subject performs action ("She wrote the book")
- Passive voice: Subject receives action ("The book was written by her")
- Prefer active voice for clarity and directness
- Use passive only when actor is unknown/unimportant or to emphasize recipient

## Dialogue Formatting

### Basic Rules
- New paragraph for each speaker
- Dialogue enclosed in quotation marks
- Punctuation inside quotation marks
- Dialogue tags lowercase after speech (unless proper noun)

### Examples
- Correct: "I'm going home," she said.
- Correct: "Where are you going?" he asked.
- Correct: "I can't believe it!" Jane exclaimed.

### Dialogue Tags
- "Said" is nearly invisible—use liberally
- Use distinctive tags sparingly (muttered, exclaimed, etc.)
- Action beats can replace tags: "I'm leaving." She slammed the door.

### Internal Dialogue
- Italics for direct internal thoughts: *I can't believe this is happening*, she thought.
- Regular text for indirect thoughts: She couldn't believe this was happening.

## Word Economy

### Eliminating Redundancies
- "Very unique" → "unique"
- "Past history" → "history"
- "End result" → "result"

### Strengthening Verbs
- "Walked slowly" → "shuffled/ambled"
- "Said loudly" → "shouted/yelled"
- "Looked angrily" → "glared/scowled"

### Cutting Filter Words
- "She saw the bird fly" → "The bird flew"
- "He heard the phone ring" → "The phone rang"
- "She felt cold" → "She shivered"

### Reducing Qualifiers
- Minimize: somewhat, rather, quite, very, really, just
- Example: "He was very angry" → "He was furious"

## Show vs. Tell

### Telling:
- Directly states facts, emotions, or qualities
- Useful for: transitions, summarizing, conveying simple information
- Example: "John was nervous."

### Showing:
- Demonstrates through action, dialogue, or physical response
- Creates vivid, immersive experience
- Example: "John's hands trembled as he fumbled with his keys."

### When to Tell:
- Transitioning between scenes
- Conveying necessary but not dramatic information
- Summarizing events that aren't central to plot

### When to Show:
- Emotional moments
- Character-defining scenes
- Critical plot developments
- Establishing setting/atmosphere

### Techniques for Showing:
1. **Physical reactions**: "Her stomach knotted"
2. **Dialogue**: What characters say and how they say it
3. **Actions**: What characters do in response to situations
4. **Thoughts**: Internal dialogue revealing character
5. **Sensory details**: What characters see, hear, feel, smell, taste
