- Heavy use of internal monologue and subtext
- Present tense narration
- Chapter structure: small annoyance → escalation → imperfect resolution

- First page includes author information, approximate word count, title, and byline
- Chapter headings are centered and in all caps
- Text is double-spaced with first-line paragraph indents
- Each chapter starts on a new page
- Properly formatted dialogue with appropriate punctuation

## Collaboration Workflow
- Project files are synced with Google Docs for easy access and collaboration
- Chapters can be edited in Google Docs or locally with automatic syncing
- Proper manuscript formatting is maintained across platforms
- Version history is tracked in both Google Docs and local repository
- Collaborators can provide feedback and suggestions through Google Docs comments

## Key Themes
- The value of doing nothing in a world obsessed with productivity
- The absurdity of reality television and fame
- Finding community while maintaining independence
- The clash between authentic island life and commercial exploitation
- The strength required to protect your peace
