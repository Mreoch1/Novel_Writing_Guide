# Project Guidelines: Doing Nothing, Badly

## Project Overview
"Doing Nothing, Badly" is a comedy novel centered around an unnamed tech millionaire who wants nothing more than to relax in peace on his remote tropical island. When a reality TV show invades his sanctuary, he must navigate a series of small but increasingly absurd annoyances while trying to maintain his do-nothing lifestyle.

## Narrative Style Guidelines
- **Voice**: First-person or close third-person with heavy interiority
- **Tone**: Dry, sardonic, observational humor
- **Structure**: Self-contained chapters that build on a loose series of escalating annoyances
- **Pacing**: Slow and deliberate, with emphasis on the protagonist's reluctance
- **Comedy Style**: Situational, dialogue-heavy, with absurdist elements
- **Stakes**: Intentionally low and personal, never world-changing

## Character Guidelines
- **Protagonist**: Keep him relatable despite his wealth; his desire for peace is universal
- **Supporting Cast**: Quirky but grounded; avoid caricatures
- **Reality Show Crew**: Varying levels of self-importance and delusion
- **Islanders**: Mix of opportunists and genuinely odd people
- **Character Development**: Subtle, focused on small realizations rather than major transformations

## Setting Guidelines
- **Island Description**: Specific but not over-described; focus on the contrast between natural beauty and increasing commercialization
- **Climate**: Hot, occasionally uncomfortable, but generally paradise-like
- **Infrastructure**: Minimal and sometimes unreliable (sporadic internet, etc.)
- **Economy**: Cash-based, informal, relationship-driven

## Dialogue Guidelines
- **Style**: Natural, conversational, with distinct voices for different characters
- **Subtext**: Heavy use of subtext, especially for the protagonist
- **Dialect**: Some island-specific slang, but avoid stereotypical or offensive portrayals
- **Celebrity Speech**: Affected, PR-trained, occasionally revealing authentic moments

## Chapter Structure
- Each chapter should begin with a small, seemingly inconsequential problem
- The problem should escalate through misunderstandings or the protagonist's attitude
- Resolution should be imperfect, sometimes creating a new problem for later
- Length: 2,000-3,000 words per chapter
- End each chapter with a small hook or unresolved element

## Technical Writing Guidelines
- Consistent formatting throughout
- Present tense preferred
- Minimal use of adverbs
- Show don't tell, especially for emotional states
- Avoid overuse of italics for emphasis

## Content Boundaries
- No graphic violence
- Limited profanity, used only when it fits character and moment
- No explicit sexual content, but innuendo is fine
- Avoid jokes at the expense of marginalized groups
- Political commentary should be subtle and incidental rather than central

## Draft Development Process
1. Outline chapter concept focusing on a specific annoyance
2. Draft chapter with emphasis on voice and dialogue
3. Revise for pacing and comedy timing
4. Final polish for language and consistency

## Success Metrics
- Consistent voice throughout chapters
- Genuinely funny scenarios that don't require explanation
- A compelling but low-stakes arc across the narrative
- Character growth that doesn't sacrifice the comedy premise
