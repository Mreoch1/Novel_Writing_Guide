# Project Guidelines: Doing Nothing, Badly

## Core Concept
A sardonic protagonist who has perfected the art of doing nothing is forced to confront the ultimate nightmare: an intrusive Japanese game show filming on his peaceful island, complete with an incompetent translator and increasingly bizarre challenges.

## Key Elements

### Protagonist
- Miles: A professional slacker who has refined doing nothing into an art form
- Deliberately avoids productivity and structured activity
- Maintains a deliberately minimal existence on a small island
- Constantly losing his flip-flops at the most inconvenient moments (running gag)
- Reluctantly drawn into the chaos of the game show for financial gain

### Setting
- Small, somewhat remote island with limited tourist activity
- Tight-knit local community with eccentric characters
- Protagonist lives in a basic bungalow near the beach
- Limited modern conveniences (spotty internet, unreliable electricity)
- Beautiful natural scenery contrasted with invasive production equipment

### Game Show Concept
- Japanese game show with outlandish challenges and exaggerated reactions
- Single translator (Yuki) who has questionable English skills and frequently mistranslates
- Host (Takashi) speaks entirely in Japanese with extreme enthusiasm
- Contestants include a mix of Japanese celebrities and English-speaking "international guests"
- Increasingly absurd challenges that make no logical sense
- Elaborate sets and props that disrupt island life

### Tone and Style
- First-person narration with dry, sardonic voice
- Observational humor highlighting absurdity
- Minimal effort as a life philosophy
- Occasional moments of genuine connection amidst the chaos
- Running gag: protagonist constantly loses his flip-flops at crucial moments

### Narrative Arc
- Protagonist's peaceful existence disturbed by game show
- Reluctant involvement for financial reasons
- Gradual, unwilling integration into the production
- Development of unexpected connections
- Evolution of protagonist without sacrificing core identity

## Writing Style Guide
- Maintain consistent first-person voice
- Short, punchy sentences interspersed with longer observations
- Liberal use of sarcasm and understatement
- Minimal exposition, show don't tell
- Realistic dialogue with distinct character voices

## Character Development Guidelines
- Protagonist should evolve without fundamentally changing
- Supporting characters should have clear motivations and quirks
- Game show crew and contestants should be over-the-top but with hints of depth
- Local island characters provide grounding and contrast

## Chapter Structure
- Each chapter should focus on a single game show challenge or disruption
- Chapters typically 3,000-4,000 words
- Begin with protagonist's peaceful routine being disrupted
- Include at least one flip-flop loss incident per chapter
- End with reluctant preparation for next challenge or reflection on the day's absurdity

## Running Gags
- Protagonist constantly losing his flip-flops at crucial moments
- Yuki's increasingly bizarre mistranslations
- The host's excessive enthusiasm regardless of situation
- Local islanders capitalizing on the production in unexpected ways
- Protagonist's hammock repeatedly being disturbed or relocated
- Contestants misinterpreting island customs in ridiculous ways

## Technical Requirements
- Follow proper manuscript formatting
- Maintain synchronization between local files and Google Drive
- Track progress and tasks in todo.md
- Document character details and setting information in appropriate files

## Project Overview
"Doing Nothing, Badly" is a comedy novel centered around an unnamed tech millionaire who wants nothing more than to relax in peace on his remote tropical island. When a reality TV show invades his sanctuary, he must navigate a series of small but increasingly absurd annoyances while trying to maintain his do-nothing lifestyle.

## Narrative Style Guidelines
- **Voice**: First-person or close third-person with heavy interiority
- **Tone**: Dry, sardonic, observational humor
- **Structure**: Self-contained chapters that build on a loose series of escalating annoyances
- **Pacing**: Slow and deliberate, with emphasis on the protagonist's reluctance
- **Comedy Style**: Situational, dialogue-heavy, with absurdist elements
- **Stakes**: Intentionally low and personal, never world-changing

## Character Guidelines
- **Protagonist**: Keep him relatable despite his wealth; his desire for peace is universal
- **Supporting Cast**: Quirky but grounded; avoid caricatures
- **Reality Show Crew**: Varying levels of self-importance and delusion
- **Islanders**: Mix of opportunists and genuinely odd people
- **Character Development**: Subtle, focused on small realizations rather than major transformations

## Setting Guidelines
- **Island Description**: Specific but not over-described; focus on the contrast between natural beauty and increasing commercialization
- **Climate**: Hot, occasionally uncomfortable, but generally paradise-like
- **Infrastructure**: Minimal and sometimes unreliable (sporadic internet, etc.)
- **Economy**: Cash-based, informal, relationship-driven

## Dialogue Guidelines
- **Style**: Natural, conversational, with distinct voices for different characters
- **Subtext**: Heavy use of subtext, especially for the protagonist
- **Dialect**: Some island-specific slang, but avoid stereotypical or offensive portrayals
- **Celebrity Speech**: Affected, PR-trained, occasionally revealing authentic moments

## Chapter Structure
- Each chapter should begin with a small, seemingly inconsequential problem
- The problem should escalate through misunderstandings or the protagonist's attitude
- Resolution should be imperfect, sometimes creating a new problem for later
- Length: 2,000-3,000 words per chapter
- End each chapter with a small hook or unresolved element

## Technical Writing Guidelines
- Consistent formatting throughout
- Present tense preferred
- Minimal use of adverbs
- Show don't tell, especially for emotional states
- Avoid overuse of italics for emphasis

## Content Boundaries
- No graphic violence
- Limited profanity, used only when it fits character and moment
- No explicit sexual content, but innuendo is fine
- Avoid jokes at the expense of marginalized groups
- Political commentary should be subtle and incidental rather than central

## Draft Development Process
1. Outline chapter concept focusing on a specific annoyance
2. Draft chapter with emphasis on voice and dialogue
3. Revise for pacing and comedy timing
4. Final polish for language and consistency

## Success Metrics
- Consistent voice throughout chapters
- Genuinely funny scenarios that don't require explanation
- A compelling but low-stakes arc across the narrative
- Character growth that doesn't sacrifice the comedy premise

## About This Project

The Novel Writing Guide was created to provide a comprehensive, accessible reference for novel writers at all stages of development. It synthesizes best practices from numerous writing craft books, professional editors, and successful authors into a streamlined, practical format.

This guide is not meant to be prescriptive but rather to offer structured guidance that can be adapted to individual writing styles and creative visions. The ultimate goal is to support writers in creating the best possible novels while understanding the technical and professional standards of the publishing industry.
