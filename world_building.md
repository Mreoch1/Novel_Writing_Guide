# World-Building

## Setting & Atmosphere

### Types of Settings
- **Urban**: Cities, towns, metropolitan areas
  - Consider: Architecture, population density, neighborhoods, infrastructure
  - Example: London in "Sherlock Holmes" stories
- **Rural**: Countryside, farms, villages, wilderness
  - Consider: Landscape, isolation, community dynamics, relationship to land
  - Example: Yorkshire moors in "Wuthering Heights"
- **Historical**: Past eras and time periods
  - Consider: Period-accurate details, social norms, technology limitations
  - Example: 1920s New York in "The Great Gatsby"
- **Futuristic**: Imagined future worlds
  - Consider: Technology advancements, social evolution, environmental changes
  - Example: Earth's colonies in "The Expanse" series
- **Fantastical**: Imaginary realms and magical places
  - Consider: Physical laws, magical systems, geography, unique flora/fauna
  - Example: Middle-earth in "The Lord of the Rings"

### Creating Atmospheric Settings

## World-Building Techniques

### Research-Based Approaches
- **Historical Models**:
  - Base fictional cultures on historical precedents
  - Research similar environments and adaptations
  - Study historical transitions for realistic change
  
- **Anthropological Methods**:
  - Consider how environment shapes culture
  - Develop interconnected cultural systems
  - Explore how belief systems affect daily life
  
- **Scientific Foundations**:
  - Ensure physical laws are consistent (even if different from our world)
  - Consider ecological relationships
  - Apply principles from geography, biology, physics as appropriate

### Creative Approaches
- **The Iceberg Method**:
  - Develop 90% more world than readers will explicitly see
  - Create depth through implication and reference
  - Allow details to emerge naturally, not as information dumps
  
- **Inside-Out Building**:
  - Start with immediately relevant setting details
  - Expand outward as the story requires
  - Develop most detail for areas directly experienced by characters
  
- **Sensory Immersion Technique**:
  - Develop distinct sensory profiles for different locations
  - Consider how the world sounds, smells, feels, and tastes
  - Use sensory details to create immediate reader engagement

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls
- **Info-Dumping**:
  - Integrate world information through character experience
  - Reveal details when relevant to plot
  - Use dialogue and conflict to naturally expose world rules
  
- **Planet of Hats Syndrome**:
  - Avoid single-trait cultures and societies
  - Include internal diversity and dissenting views
  - Develop regional and individual variations
  
- **Inconsistency Issues**:
  - Track world rules and details in a bible/guide
  - Check new elements against established facts
  - Consider long-term implications of world elements

### World-Building Documentation
- Create maps (physical, political, cultural)
- Develop timelines of historical events
- Compile cultural notes (religions, customs, language)
- Track character knowledge of the world
- Document rules for magic/technology systems

## Integration with Character and Plot

### Environment Shapes Character
- How setting influences character psychology
- Cultural values reflected in character decisions
- Physical capabilities determined by environment
- Character knowledge limited by world position

### Character Perception Filters World
- Show setting through character biases
- Different characters notice different details
- Cultural background affects interpretation
- Emotional state colors environmental description

### Plot Arising from Setting
- Conflicts inherent to the world's structure
- Natural challenges from environment
- Social tensions from cultural elements
- Technological/magical problems and solutions

### Revealing World Through Story
- Introduce world elements as they become relevant
- Use character discovery to guide reader learning
- Create "fish out of water" situations to explain norms
- Balance exposition with action
- Use conflict to highlight important world aspects
