## Formatting Guidelines
- Pages have one inch margins on all sides
- Text is double-spaced
- Paragraphs have their first line indented one-half inch from the left
- Include approximate word count in the upper right-hand corner of the first page (rounded to the nearest one hundred words)
- Use a standard, readable font (typically 12pt Times New Roman)
- Header information should only appear on the first page
- For subsequent pages, include your last name, title (or partial title), and page number in the header

## How To Apply This Format
1. When formatting chapters, follow this structure but replace the placeholder text with your actual information
2. Ensure chapter files maintain consistent formatting throughout
3. When compiling the full manuscript, each chapter should start on a new page
4. Keep spacing and indentation consistent throughout all chapters

## Word Count
To find your word count in most word processors:
- Microsoft Word: Review tab → Word Count (or status bar at bottom of screen)
- Google Docs: Tools → Word Count
- Other editors: Look for Word Count in the Tools or View menu

For "Doing Nothing, Badly," each chapter should aim for 2,000-3,000 words as specified in the project guidelines.
