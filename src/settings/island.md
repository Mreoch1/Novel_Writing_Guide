# Muta'aina Island

## Basic Information
- **Official Name:** Muta'aina (but locals use different pronunciations)
- **Nickname:** "Mute" by expats, "The Forgotten One" in tourist brochures
- **Location:** South Pacific, technically unclaimed territory
- **Size:** Small enough to walk across in a day if motivated (which no one is)
- **Population:** Around 200 permanent residents, fluctuating tourist population
- **Discovery:** Officially "discovered" five different times by five different explorers, none of whom bothered to report it

## Geography
- Roughly crescent-shaped with a dormant volcano at its center
- Three main beaches: Tourist Beach (east), Local Beach (west), Secret Beach (north)
- Dense jungle interior with barely maintained paths
- Several freshwater springs and one modest waterfall
- Natural harbor on the south side
- Coral reef surrounding most of the island
- Several small uninhabited satellite islets accessible at low tide

## Climate
- Hot and humid with two seasons: "Wet" and "Wetter"
- Predictable afternoon rain showers lasting exactly 22 minutes
- Occasional tropical storms, rarely serious enough to interrupt happy hour

## Infrastructure
- Spotty electricity from a combination of generators and solar panels

- One main dirt road circling the island, with smaller paths branching off
- Small dock for supply boats and the occasional yacht
- No airport, just a clearing where a helicopter could land in an emergency
- Cell phone service that inexplicably works best while standing in the ocean
