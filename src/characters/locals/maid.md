# Leilani (The Maid)

## Basic Information
- **Full Name:** Leilani Kalama
- **Age:** 58
- **Occupation:** Miles' housekeeper, unofficial property manager, and reluctant life advisor
- **Years on the Island:** Born and raised, briefly left for school, returned permanently
- **Residence:** Small cottage about 10 minutes from Miles' place, which she keeps in better condition than his

## Physical Appearance
- Short and sturdy with an impressively straight posture
- Salt-and-pepper hair always wrapped in a practical but colorful scarf
- Favors loose, bright-colored clothing with multiple pockets
- Reading glasses on a beaded chain around her neck
- Carries a wooden spoon in her back pocket "just in case"
- Perpetual expression of mild disapproval masking genuine amusement
- Flip-flops that somehow make an authoritative clicking sound when she walks

## Background
Leilani comes from one of the island's oldest families. After getting a degree in hotel management on the mainland (which she mentions whenever Miles is being particularly difficult), she returned to care for her aging parents and never left again.

She initially agreed to clean Miles' place "just once" as a favor to Kip when Miles first arrived. Five years later, she's essentially running Miles' life, a fact they both pretend not to acknowledge. She has gradually expanded her role from basic cleaning to managing every aspect of Miles' domestic existence.

She's known on the island as the only person who can get Miles to do anything he doesn't want to do, a power she wields sparingly and only when absolutely necessary.

## Relationship with Miles
Leilani and Miles have an unspoken agreement: she enables his laziness by handling everything domestic, and he pretends not to notice how completely dependent he is on her. Miles pays her an exorbitant salary (which she largely puts into a college fund for her grandchildren), and she pretends it's a normal amount for dusting and changing sheets.

Their actual relationship is somewhere between employer/employee, mother/son, and warden/prisoner. She treats his home as her domain where his preferences are merely suggestions, and he complains just enough to maintain the illusion that he has any say in how his household runs.

Leilani's services include:
- Cleaning his bungalow twice weekly
- Changing his sheets (which he claims is unnecessary)
- Doing his laundry (though he owns minimal clothing)
- Maintaining his property to prevent jungle encroachment
- Occasionally cooking meals she claims he "needs for nutrients"
- Vetoing his worst ideas with a single look
- Providing unsolicited life advice he pretends to ignore but secretly values

## Personality Traits
- **Core Desire:** To maintain order in a chaotic world
- **Fear:** That her family's connection to the island will be lost to modernization
- **Fatal Flaw:** Inability to stop herself from taking care of people who should care for themselves
- **Redeeming Quality:** Genuine wisdom and care beneath her stern exterior
- **Voice:** Direct, economical with words, occasional pointed proverbs
- **Defense Mechanism:** Busying herself with tasks when emotions run too high
- **Worldview:** Everything and everyone needs maintenance, whether they admit it or not

## Habits & Quirks
- Rearranges Miles' few possessions according to a system only she understands
- Leaves fruit in specific arrangements as a communication system (upside-down mango = disapproval)
- Speaks to plants encouragingly while threatening inanimate objects
- Refuses to acknowledge when she's done something nice ("I was doing it anyway.")
- Has specific songs she hums for different cleaning tasks
- Carries small traditional remedies for every possible ailment
- Always knows when Miles is hiding something (literally or figuratively)

## Skills & Abilities
- Can remove any stain from any fabric using mysterious homemade concoctions
- Makes predictions about weather more accurate than any forecast
- Knows exactly how much food and supplies are in Miles' home at all times
- Can silently enter and leave a room without being noticed
- Communicates volumes of meaning with a single raised eyebrow
- Maintains Miles' home despite his best efforts to live in squalor
- Makes the world's best banana bread (which she uses as behavior reinforcement)

## Philosophy & Quotes
- "Clean space, clean mind. Your mind must be very dirty."
- "I'm not fixing it for you. I'm fixing it because I can't look at it anymore."
- "My grandmother would have called this lazy. I call it pathetic. You're making progress."
- "Sleep in filth if you want. I'll wait until you're gone to change the sheets."
- "Money doesn't make a man clean. Or smart. Or worth talking to. You're proof."

## Response to the Reality Show
Leilani is deeply suspicious of the reality show and considers it a personal affront to her island. She's particularly concerned about how it will affect Miles, though she'd never admit to worrying about his well-being.

She's already preparing for the inevitable disaster by:
- Stocking extra cleaning supplies for when "those television people make a mess"
- Creating a schedule to clean when cameras won't be around (she refuses to be filmed)
- Planning to sabotage any attempts to film inside Miles' home without proper permission
- Collecting information about the crew from her extensive family network
- Preparing extra banana bread as stress management for herself (not for Miles, she insists)

The production team quickly learned to fear her after she "accidentally" sprayed the first camera operator who tried to enter Miles' bungalow without permission.
