# The Goat (Councilmember)

## Basic Information
- **Name:** Officially "Councilmember Seven," informally called different names by different islanders
- **Miles' Name for It:** "The Politician"
- **Age:** Estimated 6-8 years (elder statesman in goat years)
- **Occupation:** Island Council Member, occasional lawn maintenance
- **Years on the Island:** Appeared mysteriously after a storm 5 years ago
- **Residence:** Technically free-range, but primarily resides near the Council Building

## Physical Appearance
- Medium-sized with predominantly white coat and black patches
- One horn slightly crooked from an unknown past incident
- Surprisingly well-groomed for a wild goat
- Distinctive black "mask" marking around eyes, giving the impression of thoughtfulness
- Small bell on a red collar, origin unknown
- Unnaturally steady gaze for a goat

## Background
No one knows where the goat came from. It appeared on the island after a particularly violent storm five years ago, already wearing its distinctive red collar with a small brass bell. Theories range from "escaped from a passing yacht" to "swam from another island" to Lani Palu's insistence that it's the reincarnation of her great-uncle Tomi, who was "both stubborn and wise."

The goat's presence at the Council Building during an important meeting was initially seen as a nuisance, until it repeatedly headbutted the council member proposing a new tax. When a vote was called, the tally ended in a tie, and the goat's decisive bleat was jokingly counted as the deciding vote. Since then, tradition has held, and "Councilmember Seven" has been an official (if unorthodox) part of island governance.

## "Personality" Traits
- **Core Desire:** Access to the best grazing spots and occasional treats from the store
- **Fatal Flaw:** Tendency to eat important documents
- **Redeeming Quality:** Uncanny ability to identify bad ideas through selective headbutting
- **Defense Mechanism:** Freezing in place when directly addressed in council meetings
- **Worldview:** Unknown, but presumably focused on optimal foraging and minimal human interference

## "Relationships"
- **With Miles:** Strange mutual understanding; the goat often seeks out Miles' hammock for nearby grazing
- **With Kip:** Respectful distance; the goat never enters the bar but waits patiently outside for scraps
- **With The Palu Siblings:** Receives premium produce and is rumored to be their informant
- **With Island Council:** Respected, feared, and occasionally resented by other members
- **With Island at Large:** Treated with a mix of affection and superstition

## Habits & Quirks
- Appears precisely on time for council meetings, despite having no concept of time
- Stands on exact same spot during each meeting (has its own cushion)
- Eats only proposed legislation that later proves to be problematic
- Visits each part of the island in what appears to be a regular patrol pattern
- Can open certain doors and gates despite lacking opposable thumbs
- Follows visitors it disapproves of until they become uncomfortable
- Mysteriously vanishes during storms and reappears after

## "Political Record"
- Voted against all proposed tax increases (by eating the proposals)
- Approved beach cleanup initiatives (by standing attentively during presentations)
- Rejected three resort development proposals (through aggressive headbutting)
- Maintained neutral stance on fishing regulations (by sleeping through the discussion)
- Single-handedly blocked jet ski rentals (by repeatedly unplugging the proposal presenter's laptop)
- Consistently supports improvements to the dock and paths (by leading processions to problem areas)

## Island Superstitions About The Goat
- Looking directly in its eyes during a full moon will reveal your future
- If it sleeps near your house, expect good fortune
- The direction it faces during rainfall indicates where the next supply boat will come from
- Its bell ringing three times without movement is an omen (though opinions differ on whether good or bad)
- The goat can sense dishonesty and will eat the possessions of liars
- It's bad luck to refer to it as "just a goat"

## Response to the Reality Show
The goat voted against the reality show at the council meetingâ€”the only dissenting vote. Since then, it has demonstrated clear disapproval by appearing in the background of test shots, staring accusingly at cameras, and occasionally chewing on unattended equipment.

The production team initially found the goat amusing, but have become increasingly unsettled by its constant presence and unblinking stare. Several crew members have reported the distinct feeling that the goat is "judging them."

The show's producers are split between wanting to make the goat a quirky island mascot for the show and being genuinely disturbed by its apparently deliberate camera sabotage.

## Role in the Story
- Comic relief through perfectly timed appearances and reactions
- Mysterious presence that might be more than it appears
- Miles' occasional ally who creates chaos that works in his favor
- Running joke about whether the goat actually understands everything
- Potential plot device when the goat's council vote becomes crucial
- Symbol of the island's resistance to change and outside influence

## Notes for Writing
- The goat never does anything explicitly supernatural, but its timing and behaviors allow for reader interpretation
- Its actions should maintain a balance between "random animal behavior" and "suspiciously intelligent interference"
- The goat's presence often precedes important plot developments
- Different characters have different relationships with and interpretations of the goat
- Miles finds the goat's presence oddly comforting despite his general misanthropy
