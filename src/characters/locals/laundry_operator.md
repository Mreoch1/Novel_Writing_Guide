# Vinny (Laundromat Operator)

## Basic Information
- **Full Name:** Vincent "Vinny" Moretti
- **Age:** 62
- **Occupation:** Owner/operator of "Spin Island," the island's only laundromat
- **Years on the Island:** 7
- **Residence:** Small apartment above his laundromat

## Physical Appearance
- Short, round, and perpetually sweaty in the tropical heat
- Bald head that's always shiny, whether from sweat or the obsessive polishing he gives it
- Thick mustache that hasn't changed style since 1978
- Always wearing the same uniform: white tank top, knee-length shorts, and slide sandals
- Reading glasses perched permanently at the end of his nose
- Gold chain with a small washing machine charm
- Arms with faded tattoos from his Navy days

## Background
Vinny ran a successful chain of laundromats in New Jersey until his third divorce and an IRS audit convinced him to "retire" somewhere without extradition. He arrived on Muta'aina with a shipping container full of commercial washing machines and opened the island's first (and only) laundromat.

Despite his self-proclaimed "retirement," Vinny works obsessively, treating his laundromat like a temple to cleanliness. He knows the washing preferences of every resident and takes personal offense if anyone attempts to do their own laundry at home.

He's obsessed with "proper laundry procedure" and will lecture anyone who'll listen about water temperature, fabric content, and the evils of fabric softener.

## Relationship with Miles
Vinny and Miles formed an immediate bond based on their mutual appreciation of minimal effort and maximum complaining. Though Leilani technically handles Miles' laundry, Miles makes a weekly pilgrimage to "Spin Island" just to sit in Vinny's air-conditioned office, drink cold beer from Vinny's private refrigerator, and listen to Vinny's conspiracy theories about fabric manufacturing.

Miles is the only person on the island who Vinny allows to use his "special" machines in the back room, though Miles has never actually done his own laundry. Their friendship consists mainly of sharing comfortable silence, occasionally broken by Vinny's rants about proper stain treatment or Miles' observations about particularly ridiculous island happenings.

Vinny considers Miles the only person on the island with "any sense in his head," primarily because Miles never interrupts his monologues and always nods at appropriate intervals.

## Response to the Reality Show
Vinny is aggressively indifferent to the show itself but immediately recognized the business opportunity. He's preparing for an influx of laundry from the production team and contestants while simultaneously planning to charge premium rates for "rush service" and "camera-ready pressing."

He's particularly excited about the inevitable stain challenges that reality shows produce and has already prepared special treatments for everything from tropical fruit to challenge mud.

His main concern is that the show might reveal his location to "certain individuals back in Jersey who might still be asking questions." He's considering wearing a disguise if cameras enter his establishment.
