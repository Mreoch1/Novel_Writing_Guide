# The Coconut Guy (Paco)

## Basic Information
- **Name:** Paco (no last name ever offered or asked for)
- **Age:** Early 20s, probably
- **Occupation:** Island's unofficial delivery service and Miles' primary logistics manager
- **Years on the Island:** Born there
- **Residence:** No fixed address; seems to sleep in various hammocks around the island

## Physical Appearance
- Lanky build with surprising strength
- Always wears the same style of faded cargo shorts with endless pockets
- Collection of vintage tourist t-shirts from places he's never visited
- Flip-flops held together by creative repairs
- Sun-bleached hair that hasn't seen scissors in years
- Perpetually carries a machete that looks older than he is
- Can balance improbable amounts of items on his ancient bicycle

## Background
Paco is the youngest son of a local fishing family who discovered early on that carrying things for rich expats was far easier than fishing. He started as Miles' coconut supplier but gradually expanded his role to become the island's one-man delivery service.

For a small fee (or more often, barter arrangements), Paco will deliver anything to anyone, anywhere on the island. His uncanny knowledge of everyone's routines and preferences has made him indispensable, especially to Miles, who considers standing up to get his own supplies a tragic waste of hammock time.

No one knows exactly how Paco gets certain items to the island, but he has never once failed to deliver something requested, no matter how obscure. His network of "cousins" on supply boats and passing yachts remains mysterious but effective.

## Relationship with Miles
Paco and Miles have the perfect symbiotic relationship. Miles has money and doesn't want to move; Paco will move things for money. Their arrangement has evolved into a complex system where Miles barely needs to speak full sentences for Paco to understand his needs.

For a monthly retainer (which Miles considers the best money he's ever spent), Paco:
- Delivers fresh coconuts twice weekly
- Brings groceries from the general store
- Collects mail from Kip's
- Handles basic home maintenance
- Sources obscure items without questions
- Maintains Miles' rum supply with religious devotion
- Acts as an early warning system for unwanted visitors

To maximize efficiency (and minimize human interaction), Miles installed a special delivery box near his porch where Paco can drop items and collect payment without either of them needing to engage in conversation.

## Personality Traits
- **Core Desire:** To perfect the art of minimal effort for maximum gain
- **Fear:** Any form of structured employment
- **Fatal Flaw:** Can't resist knowing everyone's business
- **Redeeming Quality:** Absolute reliability despite chaotic appearance

- **Defense Mechanism:** Strategic incomprehension when asked inconvenient questions
- **Worldview:** Everything and everyone is connected by a web of favors and exchanges

## Habits & Quirks

- Never writes anything down but never forgets an order

## Philosophy & Quotes

- "If you carry, you in charge. I always carry."
- "Everyone needs something. If you know what, you never hungry."

## Response to the Reality Show
Paco views the reality show as the single greatest business opportunity of his life. He immediately positioned himself as the production crew's go-to for local logistics, while simultaneously offering his services to the contestants for "personal item retrieval" at premium rates.

He's already arranged to sell contestant information to interested locals and island gossip to the production staff. He's also running a side business selling "authentic island souvenirs" (that he makes in his spare time) to crew members.

Most concerning to Miles: Paco has been seen in deep conversation with Madison, potentially revealing details about Miles' routine and hideaways in exchange for production team perks.

## Role in the Story
- Miles' primary enabler of laziness
- Connection between different island factions
- Source of critical items at convenient moments
- Information broker who knows what's happening before anyone else
- Potential betrayer of Miles' privacy to the production team
- Comic relief through his increasingly elaborate delivery methods as the show creates obstacles
