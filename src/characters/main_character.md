# Main Character: Miles Thorne

## Basic Information
- **Full Name:** Miles Thorne
- **Age:** 37
- **Occupation:** Former accidental tech millionaire, currently professional beach bum
- **Years on the Island:** 5

## Background
Miles was a mediocre web developer who stumbled upon a nearly complete AI project in the apartment of his recently deceased neighbor. The neighbor, a brilliant but reclusive programmer, had no family, and the landlord asked Miles to clear out the apartment. Miles finished the project, sold it to a tech giant for millions, and promptly disappeared from society before anyone could ask too many questions.

He's not a tech genius—just lucky—and he knows it. This self-awareness both grounds him and fuels his imposter syndrome.

- **Redeeming Quality:** Unexpected moments of genuine kindness
- **Voice:** Dry, sardonic, occasionally philosophical when drunk
- **Defense Mechanism:** Feigned incompetence to avoid being asked to do things
- **Worldview:** Society is an unnecessary complication; simplicity is the ultimate achievement

## Relationships
- **Best Friend:** Kip, the bartender/postmaster who doesn't ask questions
- **"The Coconut Guy":** Unnamed local who delivers fresh coconuts twice weekly
- **Island Council:** Reluctantly attends quarterly meetings, usually votes against everything
- **Recurring Annoyance:** Helena, an efficiency-obsessed expat who keeps trying to "improve" island life
- **The Goat (Councilmember):** Has an inexplicable mutual understanding with the island's goat representative

## Philosophy & Quotes
- "Peace is expensive. I already paid for it."
- "The less you do, the less you have to fix later."
- "Progress is just a fancy word for 'new problems.'"
- "Boredom is a luxury item. I can afford plenty."
- "Success is measured by the number of days you don't have to set an alarm."

## Character Arc Potential
While Miles values his isolation, the reality show invasion might force him to:
1. Build actual friendships rather than convenient acquaintances
2. Confront his avoidance of his past
3. Develop a sense of responsibility toward the island community
4. Find a balance between solitude and connection
5. Come to terms with his accidental success

All without sacrificing his core belief in the value of doing as little as possible, as well as possible.
