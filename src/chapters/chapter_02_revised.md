Chapter 2: The Calm Before the Storm

The cat, as I had predicted, was not lost. Mrs. Kahale opened her door at exactly the moment her wayward feline decided to saunter up the path behind us, looking smug and slightly disheveled, like a teenager returning from prom.

"Mr. Miles! You found him already!" Mrs. Kahale exclaimed, her face lighting up with the kind of joy usually reserved for lottery winners and people who find extra fries at the bottom of the bag.

"I have a gift," I said dryly, watching as the cat—an enormous orange tabby named Chairman Meow—rubbed against my ankles, leaving a trail of suspicious white fur on my bare feet. Definitely visiting his girlfriend again.

Mrs. Kahale scooped up the Chairman, who accepted her affection with the magnanimous tolerance of a deity receiving tribute. "Come in, come in! The scotch is waiting."

Kip gave me a knowing wink. "I'll pick you up on my way back. Don't solve too many cases while I'm gone."

"Solving cases would require energy I'm not willing to expend," I called after him as he drove away.

Inside Mrs. Kahale's immaculately kept bungalow, everything was exactly where it had been during my last reluctant feline rescue mission. The furniture was arranged to maximize the view of the ocean, with an ancient rattan rocking chair positioned to catch both the morning breeze and the afternoon sun. Family photos covered every flat surface, generations of Kahales smiling out from hand-carved frames. The house smelled of plumeria flowers and fresh-baked banana bread.

Mrs. Kahale was the island's unofficial historian, a retired schoolteacher who had taught half the adult population their ABCs and the other half how to properly apologize for childhood misdeeds. She was in her eighties now but moved with the easy grace of someone who had spent a lifetime dancing hula and swimming in the ocean.

"You're barefoot again," she observed, setting Chairman Meow down on a cat tree that was nicer than most human furniture I'd owned. "Did your flip-flops run away?"

"They're exploring their independence," I replied, settling into the chair she offered. "I respect their journey of self-discovery."

She chuckled, then disappeared into the kitchen, returning with two glasses and the promised bottle of scotch. The label was handwritten, with a small sketched logo that would never appear in a liquor store display. This was the good stuff, the kind that made you wish you had more sophisticated adjectives to describe it than just "really damn good."

"So," she said, pouring two generous fingers into each glass, "you're getting a television show next door."

I accepted the scotch with a grateful nod. "News travels faster than light on this island."

"Leilani called me right after Madison left your place. Said you were getting paid to let Japanese people walk across your property."

"Not exactly. I'm allowing them to disturb my peace and giving them a right-of-way. The money was optional."

Mrs. Kahale raised an eyebrow over her glass. "You turned down payment?"

"I have enough money." It was true, though still strange to say aloud even years after the Bitcoin revelation. I went from living paycheck to paycheck as a detective to having more wealth than I knew what to do with. My financial advisor kept trying to get me to "diversify my portfolio" and "make strategic investments," but I was content to live simply off what he called the "conservative interest." My biggest expense was shipping scotch to the island.

"Having money and accepting more aren't mutually exclusive," Mrs. Kahale said with the wisdom of someone who had lived through enough economic ups and downs to know the value of cash reserves. "But I understand. Some things are worth more than money."

"Like peace and quiet," I agreed, sipping the scotch. It tasted like liquid gold filtered through peat bogs and blessed by Scottish angels. "This, however, was worth the effort of pretending to look for a cat that wasn't lost."

She laughed. "The Chairman appreciates your discretion about his romantic escapades. His reputation as a homebody is important to him."

Chairman Meow yawned dramatically from his perch, displaying a pink tongue and teeth that had definitely been busy with something other than kibble recently.

"So what's this show about?" Mrs. Kahale asked, settling into her own chair. "Leilani said it was some kind of competition."

"Japanese game show. Apparently they make people eat strange things and hit each other with foam props while dressed as marine life."

"Sounds entertaining."

"For certain definitions of entertainment that I don't subscribe to."

"Maybe you should participate," she suggested with a mischievous gleam in her eye. "Put those detective skills to use."

I nearly choked on my scotch. "My detective skills are retired. Permanently."

"Skills don't retire, Miles. Only people do."

"Well, this person is very happily retired."

This was an old conversational dance between us. Mrs. Kahale believed my talent for finding things—missing cats, lost wedding rings, occasionally people who didn't want to be found—was a gift that shouldn't go to waste. I believed that after fifteen years of looking at crime scene photos and hearing victims' families ask questions I couldn't answer, I had earned the right to never use my observational skills for anything more strenuous than locating the perfect hammock position.

"The thing about retirement," she continued, undeterred, "is that it gives you time to do what matters. Not nothing—something."

I sighed. Mrs. Kahale was the only person on the island who could lecture me without triggering my urge to walk into the ocean. Perhaps because she always paired her wisdom with excellent scotch.

"What matters to me is the perfect ratio of napping to not napping," I said. "I've nearly perfected it. Sixty-five percent napping, thirty-five percent contemplating the next nap."

She smiled. "And yet here you are, helping find a cat."

"Only because of bribery." I raised my glass. "Very effective bribery."

"Mm-hmm." Her tone suggested she didn't believe me for a moment. "Next you'll tell me you're not going to help when Vinny's daughter loses her bicycle again."

I groaned. Vinny's daughter, a precocious eight-year-old named Lily, had a purple bicycle that regularly went "missing," which was her code for "I left it somewhere and don't remember where." She had somehow gotten the idea that I was a "super detective" who could find anything, and her wide-eyed faith in my abilities made it impossible to refuse her requests.

"That's different," I muttered. "She cries if I say no."

"And that bothers you because...?"

"Because I'm not a monster. Just lazy."

Mrs. Kahale's laugh was like wind chimes. "Miles, you're many things, but lazy isn't one of them. You just choose your efforts carefully."

"Very, very carefully."

We sat in comfortable silence for a while, sipping scotch and listening to the Chairman's rhythmic purring. Through the open windows, I could hear the distant sounds of the ocean and, less pleasantly, the voices of the production crew setting up equipment on the beach.

"You know," Mrs. Kahale said after a while, "this show might be good for the island. Tourism has been down since the hurricane. Leilani's been worried about keeping the store open, and Vinny's laundromat barely breaks even most months."

I nodded reluctantly. The locals had become something like family over the years—unwanted, occasionally annoying family who kept asking me to find things, but family nonetheless. I didn't like seeing them struggle.

"I suppose temporary inconvenience isn't the end of the world," I conceded. "As long as they keep the chaos contained."

"Chaos is rarely containable," she observed. "That's what makes it chaos."

"Thank you for that philosophical insight. Very comforting."

She smiled and poured me another finger of scotch. "Consider it preparation for what's coming. Speaking of which, do you know when filming actually starts?"

"According to Madison, they begin setup next week, with filming the week after." I swirled the amber liquid in my glass. "Which gives me approximately ten days to prepare for the invasion."

"What kind of preparation does one do for a Japanese game show? Besides buying squid costumes."

"I was thinking more along the lines of reinforcing my hammock's structural integrity and stockpiling enough rum to outlast a siege."

"Ah, the Miles approach to crisis management."

"It's worked so far."

After finishing my second scotch—stopping at two was an iron rule when drinking something this good; any more and the subtleties were lost—I thanked Mrs. Kahale and promised to check in on her during the filming chaos.

"Don't worry about me," she said, walking me to the door. "I've already been approached about renting out my spare room to one of the producers. They're paying triple the normal rate."

I stared at her. "You're harboring the enemy?"

"I'm practicing capitalism. Besides, he's a very nice young man from Osaka. Says he'll teach me to make proper sushi." She patted my arm. "Not everyone sees change as a threat, Miles."

"Change is fine. Disruption is the problem."

As I stepped onto her porch, I noticed my left flip-flop sitting neatly beside the welcome mat. I was certain I hadn't brought it with me.

Mrs. Kahale followed my gaze. "It showed up about an hour before you did. Washed up right on my beach."

"My flip-flops are disturbingly good at navigation."

"Maybe they're trying to tell you something."

"If they could talk, they'd probably just ask for better foot deodorant."

She laughed and waved as I walked away, one foot clad in the prodigal flip-flop, the other bare. Kip would be back soon to pick me up, but I decided to walk for a while along the beach, away from the production crew's activity and toward the quiet cove that was one of my favorite thinking spots.

The sand was warm beneath my feet, the afternoon sun casting long shadows across the water. I found myself thinking about my life before the island—the cramped apartment in Chicago, the desk covered in case files, the nights spent staring at crime scene photos until my eyes burned. I'd been good at my job, maybe too good. I saw connections others missed, remembered details that seemed insignificant until they weren't.

My last case had broken something in me. The serial killer—they called him the Librarian because he left his victims posed with specific books—had eluded capture for twelve years. I spent six months living the case, breathing it, dreaming about it. When we finally caught him, he looked so ordinary. Just a middle-aged man with thinning hair and reading glasses who worked as an accountant. He had family photos on his desk and volunteered at an animal shelter on weekends.

His neatly organized scrapbooks contained locks of hair, personal items from his victims, and detailed notes about why each person had been chosen. He had criteria, rules, a whole system for selecting who deserved to die. Reading those notebooks was like looking into an abyss of calculated madness. I'd handed in my badge the next day.

The thumb drive with the Bitcoin had been a bizarre cosmic joke, the universe's way of saying, "Here's your retirement package for all that trauma." The tech entrepreneur whose cat I'd found as my last unofficial favor before leaving Chicago had tried to explain what Bitcoin was, but I'd barely been listening. I just took the drive because he insisted, then tossed it in a box of miscellaneous items that made the journey to the island with me.

Two years later, when the financial markets were going crazy over cryptocurrency, my old partner called to ask if I still had "that Bitcoin thing." I found the drive, consulted a financial advisor, and discovered I was suddenly wealthy enough to never work again. The absurdity wasn't lost on me—I'd spent fifteen years looking for killers and got nothing but nightmares, then found a thumb drive that made me rich.

I'd used some of the money to buy my beachfront property on Kalakahua, set up a modest trust to support the family of a victim from my last case, and donated to a few organizations working with trauma survivors. The rest sat in accounts, growing in ways I didn't understand or particularly care about, as long as it meant I never had to look at another crime scene.

As I reached the cove, I found a comfortable rock and sat down to watch the waves. The island had healed me in ways therapy never could. The rhythm of the tides, the simplicity of existence, the absence of violent death—all of it had slowly washed away the darkness that had accumulated over years of detective work.

Now this Japanese game show threatened to disrupt that peace. Not in the same way as serial killers and grieving families, of course, but any change to my carefully constructed sanctuary felt like a potential breach in the dam holding back my past.

I picked up a smooth stone and skipped it across the water's surface. One, two, three, four jumps before it sank beneath the waves. Perhaps I was overreacting. After all, it was just a television show. Two weeks of noise and chaos, then back to normal. I could handle that.

My phone vibrated in my pocket—an ancient flip phone that I kept charged solely for emergencies and the occasional text from Kip or Mrs. Kahale. I rarely carried it, but today's cat-finding expedition had warranted communication capability.

The text was from Kip: "At Mrs. K's. You wandered off?"

I typed back with the painstaking deliberation of someone who had never embraced texting as a primary form of communication: "Walking back. Meet at the beach split."

The beach split was where the shoreline forked—one path leading to Mrs. Kahale's property, the other continuing along to my bungalow. It would take Kip about five minutes to get there in his golf cart, which gave me time to enjoy a few more moments of solitude before the coming storm.

As I walked, I noticed a figure on the far end of the beach—someone I didn't recognize, talking animatedly on a phone while gesturing toward the water. Another production person, no doubt, planning where to position cameras or build whatever absurd obstacles Japanese game shows required.

I veered away, taking a path through the palm trees to avoid being spotted. The last thing I needed was to be pulled into a conversation about optimal filming angles or whatever else occupied the minds of television people.

Kip was waiting at the beach split when I arrived, his golf cart idling as he scrolled through something on his phone. He looked up as I approached.

"There's our intrepid detective, fresh from another successful case," he called out. "The Chairman is home safe?"

"He was never missing," I reminded him, climbing into the passenger seat. "He was conducting a romantic liaison."

"The eternal optimist, that cat." Kip put his phone away and steered the cart back onto the main path. "So, I've been thinking about this game show situation."

"I've asked you repeatedly not to think. It only leads to complications."

"Hear me out. What if we set up a viewing party at the bar? Special drinks themed to the show, maybe some Japanese snacks. Could be good for business."

I sighed. "You're already planning to profit from my misery."

"Not just your misery—everyone's entertainment. That's how business works." He navigated around a fallen coconut. "Besides, aren't you even a little curious about what they're going to do?"

"I'm curious about many things. The mating habits of deep-sea creatures. The average lifespan of Antarctic lichen. Whether my flip-flops have developed sentience. A Japanese game show doesn't make the list."

"You'll watch it anyway," Kip predicted with confidence. "If only to catalog the ways in which they're disturbing your peace."

He wasn't wrong. My detective habits—observing, analyzing, documenting—had never fully disappeared. They'd just been redirected toward less traumatic subjects, like tracking the migration patterns of my flip-flops or cataloging the precise rate at which ice melted in different rum cocktails.

"Mrs. Kahale says they've already rented her spare room," I said, changing the subject slightly. "How many other locals are getting pulled into this vortex?"

"Leilani's stocking up on Japanese snacks and sunscreen. Vinny's negotiating a deal to handle the production team's laundry. The Palu brothers are hiring out their boats for water shots." Kip shrugged. "Everyone's finding a way to benefit. Except you, apparently."

"My benefit is maintaining my sanity."

"Your sanity seems perfectly intact to me, considering your background."

I gave him a sharp look. Kip was one of the few people on the island who knew the full story of my detective days. Not because I'd told him—I never voluntarily discussed my past—but because he'd recognized me from a news story about the Librarian case. He'd never mentioned it to anyone else, a discretion I deeply appreciated.

"Sorry," he said, noting my expression. "Low blow. But seriously, Miles. Two weeks of minor inconvenience in exchange for the whole island getting an economic boost? Seems like a fair trade."

We pulled up to my bungalow, the late afternoon sun casting long shadows across the sand. From here, I could see the production team had expanded their beach presence—more equipment, more people, more purpose.

"I suppose resistance is futile," I conceded, stepping out of the golf cart. "But if they try to make me wear a squid hat, I'm drawing the line."

"Noted." Kip grinned. "Though you might look good with tentacles."

"Go away. I need to prepare for the apocalypse."

"Drama queen." He put the cart in reverse. "Coming to the bar tonight? First round's on me."

I considered this. The bar—officially named "The Last Post" to commemorate its dual function—was as close to a social venue as I allowed myself. Mostly because the alternative was drinking alone, which even in my dedicated pursuit of nothing seemed potentially problematic.

"Maybe. If my schedule of doing nothing opens up."

"Your dedication to your craft is truly inspiring."

After Kip left, I walked slowly around my bungalow, surveying my domain as if memorizing it before an invasion. The structure itself was simple—one large room with a separate bathroom, wide windows on all sides to catch the breeze, a small kitchen area, and a covered porch that wrapped around three sides. Outside, my hammock swayed gently between two palm trees, positioned for optimal shade throughout the day.

Most of my possessions fit into a single bookshelf and a battered sea chest that had come with the property. I owned exactly four plates, four glasses, and four sets of silverware—enough for the rare occasions when I had visitors, not so many that washing them became a chore. My clothes occupied about two feet of closet space, primarily consisting of faded t-shirts, a few pairs of shorts, and an alarming number of single flip-flops.

The only item of real value was the safe—a small, digital model bolted to the floor in the corner of the main room. It contained my passport, the Bitcoin thumb drive, and a few mementos I couldn't bring myself to discard but didn't want to look at: my detective badge, a photo of my former partner and me after solving our first major case, and a single shell casing from the bullet that had grazed my shoulder during a standoff years ago.

Everything else was functional, comfortable, and deliberately uncomplicated. The exact opposite of what a television production would bring.

I found a beer in the refrigerator and took it out to the hammock, settling in for my evening contemplation session. The horizon was turning pink and orange as the sun began its descent into the ocean. A perfect, peaceful moment that would soon be interrupted by whatever chaos a Japanese game show entailed.

"Two weeks," I said aloud to no one. "I can survive anything for two weeks."

A seagull flying overhead seemed to laugh in response, which felt like an ominous sign.

As darkness fell, I watched the production crew pack up for the day, their voices carrying on the evening breeze. Tomorrow they would return with more equipment, more people, more noise. And the day after that, and the day after that, until my peaceful existence was completely overrun.

I closed my eyes and tried to recapture my zen, but it was already contaminated with thoughts of whatever was coming. I'd survived worse, of course. Much worse. But that didn't mean I had to like it.

My remaining flip-flop chose that moment to slide off my foot and plop into the sand below the hammock.

"Et tu, flip-flop?" I murmured. Even my footwear was abandoning me in my time of need.

I left it where it fell. Some battles weren't worth fighting.

Tomorrow, I would begin my preparations in earnest. Stock up on supplies, maybe invest in those noise-canceling headphones Madison had offered. Find a more secluded spot for my hammock. Perhaps sharpen my glare for when curious production assistants inevitably wandered too close to my property line.

For now, though, I would enjoy this last quiet evening, beer in hand, barefoot by choice rather than flip-flop desertion, watching the stars emerge one by one above the peaceful ocean.

The calm before the storm.
