Chapter 3: Celebrity Collision

Monday arrived with the subtlety of a coconut falling on a tin roof.

I awoke at dawn - not by choice, but because someone was operating a chainsaw approximately twelve feet from my bedroom window. I briefly considered the possibility that I was being murdered, but quickly realized that would require far less effort on the murderer's part.

The chainsaw belonged to a production assistant named Trevor, who, upon noticing my glare through the window, cheerfully informed me that they were "just clearing a few branches for camera sight lines." Trevor had the enthusiasm of someone who had recently discovered cocaine but the decision-making authority of a houseplant.

"It's 6:30 in the morning," I said, which I felt adequately communicated my position on the matter.

"Early bird gets the worm!" Trevor replied, as if reciting a motivational calendar he'd received for Christmas.

I stared at him long enough that his smile began to falter. "Do I look like I want worms, Trevor?"

He considered this for a moment. "I guess not?"

"I want sleep. And silence. In that order."

"Right, totally, but Mr. Clarke said we need to get all the prep work done before the talent arrives at noon, so..."

I closed my window and went in search of earplugs, or possibly a tranquilizer gun that could work on humans. Finding neither, I settled for my third-best pillow over my head and a philosophical acceptance that the universe was, once again, conspiring against inactivity.

By the time I emerged from my bungalow two hours later, my beach had been transformed. Where there had once been pristine sand and scattered driftwood, there now stood lighting rigs, camera platforms, and something that could only be described as a tribal council area if the tribe in question shopped exclusively at Pier 1 Imports. 

Paco materialized beside me, clipboard in hand. "Good morning, Mr. Miles! Exciting day!"

"Is it?" I asked, genuinely curious about his definition of excitement.

"The celebrities arrive in three hours! I have their complete bios and social media profiles if you'd like to review them." He attempted to hand me a thick folder.

I made no move to take it. "I'd rather review the inside of my eyelids."

"Also, Mr. Clarke would like to speak with you about..."

"No."

"But he hasn't..."

"Still no."

Paco studied me for a moment. "He's offering an additional thousand dollars if you'll appear in the background of one shot."

This gave me pause. Money was useful, primarily because it allowed me to continue doing nothing for longer periods of time.

"What would this appearance entail?" I asked cautiously.

"Just walking along your own beach, looking... natural." He made a vague gesture that I interpreted as 'less hostile than you currently appear.'

"And how long would this take?"

"Maybe five minutes?"

"A thousand dollars for five minutes." I did the math. "That's twelve thousand dollars an hour."

"So you'll do it?"

"For that rate? I'd consider briefly caring about something."

Paco made a note on his clipboard. "I'll tell Mr. Clarke you've accepted. They'll need you at 2 PM."

"Fine. Now go away so I can prepare."

"Prepare how?"

"By doing absolutely nothing until 1:55 PM."

With that settled, I retreated to my backup hammock location, the one even Paco didn't know about. It was nestled between two large boulders and required traversing an inconvenient path - nature's way of ensuring privacy through minimum required effort.

I dozed fitfully, my dreams haunted by Trevor and his chainsaw, until hunger drove me back toward civilization around noon. As I approached my bungalow, I spotted an unfamiliar figure on my porch. She was tall, blonde, and wearing sunglasses worth more than most people's monthly rent.

I stopped short. "You're on my porch."

She turned, not startled so much as mildly inconvenienced by having to acknowledge someone else's existence. "And you are...?"

"The person whose porch you're on."

She removed her sunglasses with practiced precision. "You must be Miles. I'm Alessandra."

The name meant nothing to me.

She noted my blank expression. "Alessandra Sterling? From 'The Real Wives of Silicon Valley'?"

"Is that a documentary about computer engineers?"

Her perfectly sculpted eyebrows rose. "You really don't know who I am."

"I really don't care who you are. Why are you on my porch?"

"I wanted some peace and quiet before the cameras start rolling. This seemed like the only place no one would look for me." She gestured vaguely toward the production area where people were scurrying around like ants on an overheated sidewalk.

Against my better judgment, I felt a twinge of solidarity. "You came to an island to find peace and quiet, and instead found... this?"

"Oh, no. I came here to rejuvenate my brand. My agent says a 'gritty survival comeback' is exactly what I need after the kombucha-throwing incident."

The twinge of solidarity vanished. "There's beer in the cooler behind the house if you need something to throw."

Rather than being offended, she laughed - a genuine sound that seemed to surprise us both.

"You really aren't impressed by any of this, are you?" she asked.

"I'm impressed by how much effort people put into things that don't matter."

She considered this. "Do you mind if I stay here a bit longer? I'll pay you."

"Everyone keeps offering me money to do things I don't want to do."

"I'm offering you money to do exactly what you want to do - ignore me while I sit quietly on your porch."

I couldn't fault her logic. "Stay as long as you like. Just don't expect conversation."

"Perfect." She settled back into my porch chair and put her sunglasses back on.

True to her word, she remained silent, tapping occasionally at her phone while I rummaged around for something resembling lunch. I found half a mango and some crackers that were only slightly stale. Cuisine at its finest.

My peaceful coexistence with Alessandra was shattered at precisely 12:37 PM (I noticed because my entire philosophy revolves around tracking when peace is disrupted) by the arrival of Madison the location manager, who came charging up my path like she was late for her own wedding.

"There you are!" she exclaimed, and for a moment I wasn't sure which of us she meant. "We've been looking everywhere!"

"I've been exactly where I always am," I replied. "Here. Or somewhere else nearby."

"Not you," Madison said dismissively. "Her." She pointed at Alessandra. "Everyone's waiting for you at the welcome boat. We need to film your arrival."

"But I've already arrived," Alessandra said reasonably.

Madison's smile remained fixed but her left eye twitched slightly. "Yes, but now you need to arrive again. On camera. Looking surprised to be here."

"Can't we just use stock footage?" Alessandra asked, making no move to get up. "I'm comfortable."

"That's... not how reality television works." Madison's clipboard trembled slightly in her grip.

"Isn't it though?" I interjected. "The reality is, she's here. She arrived. You just didn't film it."

Madison turned to me with the expression of someone who had just discovered a talking cockroach. "This is why we don't involve locals in the production process."

"I'm not involved," I clarified. "I'm actively uninvolved."

"Alessandra, please." Madison's voice took on a pleading quality. "Devin is about to have an aneurysm."

"Fine." Alessandra stood with a sigh. "But I want almond milk with my coffee tomorrow. The oat milk makes me bloated, and bloated doesn't win immunity challenges."

As they departed, Madison shooting daggers with her eyes (which I skillfully dodged through the time-honored technique of not caring), I realized my peace was likely to be disrupted continually for the foreseeable future.

I had approximately one hour before I needed to appear for my five-minute, thousand-dollar walk-by. I decided to spend it strategizing how to maximize my solitude during this invasion.

I was interrupted by a commotion from the direction of the harbor. Raised voices, the rumble of boat engines, and what sounded suspiciously like a portable speaker blasting dance music. Curiosity - my persistent nemesis - got the better of me, and I wandered to the edge of my property where I could see the main dock.

A gleaming white yacht had just arrived, and from it descended the most improbable collection of humans I'd ever seen outside of a fever dream. In addition to Alessandra, who was now pretending to see the island for the first time (her surprised face looked remarkably like her regular face but with her mouth slightly open), there were eleven other "celebrities."

There was a muscle-bound man whose tank top appeared to be at least two sizes too small; twin influencers in matching outfits taking selfies with the island as backdrop; a former boy band member whose name I vaguely recalled from supermarket tabloids; a chef famous for yelling at people; an Olympic athlete who'd pivoted to acting with limited success; a woman who'd gotten famous doing something on the internet that I fundamentally didn't understand; and various others whose claim to fame remained mysterious.

They all exuded the same peculiar energy - a combination of excitement, anxiety, and the desperate need to be perceived. Each carried minimal luggage but maximum attitude. The cameras captured their every reaction as they took in their home for the next six weeks.

Standing apart from them was a man I assumed must be the host - tall, tanned, with too many teeth and an expression of manufactured concern. He spoke to the camera with practiced sincerity about "the journey these celebrities were about to embark on" and how it would "test their limits and reveal their true selves."

I doubted anything short of actual survival situations - the kind without craft services and medical teams standing by - would reveal anyone's "true self," but I wasn't being paid to point out the inherent contradictions of reality television.

Devin Clarke stood nearby, watching the proceedings with an expression of barely contained glee. This was his vision coming to life - manufactured drama in a beautiful setting, with just enough discomfort to seem authentic without actually risking anyone's well-being or, more importantly, their willingness to sign liability waivers.

As I watched, Kip's boat pulled up to the dock. From it emerged Leilani, Vinny, and several other islanders I recognized. They were dressed in what costume designers clearly thought represented "authentic island attire" - a hodgepodge of tropical shirts, straw hats, and shell necklaces that none of them would be caught dead wearing under normal circumstances.

They greeted the celebrities with the awkward enthusiasm of people who had been coached extensively on how to act natural. The celebrities responded with exaggerated delight, as if they'd just encountered a lost Amazonian tribe rather than people who had indoor plumbing and Netflix accounts.

The entire spectacle was so absurd that I almost - almost - found it entertaining. But entertainment required engagement, and engagement required energy, so I decided it was fundamentally opposed to my principles.

I checked my watch. 1:45 PM. Almost time for my thousand-dollar stroll. I briefly considered what one does to "prepare" for being filmed walking along a beach, then remembered that I fundamentally didn't care how I appeared on camera. If they wanted authentic island hermit, they were going to get authentic island hermit.

At precisely 1:55 PM, I wandered toward the designated filming area, where Paco was anxiously waiting.

"There you are!" he exclaimed. "Quick, they need you in position."

"My position is 'walking along the beach.' I'm fairly skilled at it after years of practice."

"Yes, but they need you to walk in the right direction, with the right lighting, at the right moment."

I had apparently underestimated the complexity of walking.

Paco led me to a mark on the sand, where a camera operator and Devin were waiting. Devin brightened when he saw me.

"Miles! Excellent. We're going to have you walk from here to that palm tree, looking contemplative. You're a mysterious island resident, possibly with a dark past. The viewers will wonder about you."

"I'm contemplating how quickly this will be over," I said.

Devin laughed like I'd made a joke. "Perfect! Hold onto that energy. We'll have our host, Jack, narrating about the island's few inhabitants while you walk by. Just act natural."

"My natural state is not walking when people are watching me."

"Well, your slightly less natural state, then." Devin gestured to the camera operator. "We're ready when you are."

Jack the host materialized beside us, microphone in hand, smile dazzling in the afternoon sun. "So I just mention the island's reclusive residents while he walks by?"

"Exactly," Devin confirmed. "It adds local color."

I felt distinctly like a zoo animal being gawked at, but the memory of those thousand dollars kept me in place.

"ACTION!" someone called.

Jack turned to the camera, his expression instantly transforming to one of earnest fascination. "The island isn't completely deserted. A few residents call this paradise home, living simple lives far from the complications of modern society." He gestured subtly in my direction.

That was my cue. I walked as instructed, my face arranged in what I hoped was contemplative disinterest rather than active disdain.

"Some have been here for years," Jack continued, "finding peace in isolation while the world rushes by."

I was nearly at the palm tree when I heard a commotion from the production area. A woman's voice rose above the ambient noise: "This is NOT what I was promised! Where is my private cabana?"

Jack's professional smile flickered. The camera operator's focus drifted.

"Keep rolling!" Devin hissed.

I reached the palm tree, my contractual obligation fulfilled. As I turned to leave, I spotted the source of the disturbance - a petite woman with elaborately styled hair and an outfit entirely unsuitable for any environment not featuring bottle service. She was gesturing wildly at Madison while a harried-looking assistant attempted to calm her.

"Cut!" Devin finally called out. He turned to me with a tight smile. "Perfect. Thank you, Miles. We'll wire the payment to the account Paco provided."

"Pleasure doing minimal business with you," I replied, already backing away from the circus.

As I retreated, I heard Jack mutter to Devin, "Is that Tiffany having another meltdown? We haven't even announced the teams yet."

"Just keep the cameras rolling," Devin responded. "America loves a diva."

I had nearly made it back to the safety of my bungalow when Alessandra intercepted me. She had changed into what I assumed was her "island survivor" outfit - designer cargo pants and a tank top that probably cost more than my monthly expenses.

"Your five minutes of fame over already?" she asked.

"Thankfully. Yours is just beginning."

She made a face. "Six weeks of pretending to struggle while cameras document every unflattering angle. What could go wrong?"

"You could actually struggle," I suggested. "The island doesn't care about your follower count."

"Says the man with indoor plumbing and a refrigerator."

"Fair point."

She glanced back at the growing chaos near the production area. "I should get back before they send a search party. Apparently, we're being divided into teams soon."

"Try to end up on the team that gets voted off first."

She laughed. "That's not how you win the game."

"Winning means different things to different people."

As she walked away, I heard Kip calling my name. He was approaching from the direction of Tiki & Mail, carrying what appeared to be a case of beer.

"Your regular delivery," he said, setting the case down on my porch. "Thought you might need it more than usual today."

"Your thoughtfulness will be noted in my memoir, if I ever expend the energy to write one."

Kip surveyed the production area. "It's really happening, huh?"

"Apparently."

"They've taken over the bar for tonight's 'Welcome to the Island' feast. Paying me triple my usual rate."

"Capitalism at its finest."

"Want to come? There's free food."

I stared at him until he laughed.

"Had to ask. Vinny's going. Says he wants to 'network' with the Hollywood types."

"Vinny thinks Hollywood types need laundry services on a deserted island?"

"He's optimistic. Says this is our island's chance to 'get on the map.'"

I looked around at the pristine beach now cluttered with equipment, the celebrities in their carefully curated "rugged" outfits, and the production crew manipulating every aspect of this supposedly authentic experience.

"I prefer we stay off the map," I said.

Kip nodded. "Six weeks. Then things go back to normal."

As the sun began to set, I could hear the sounds of the welcome party starting up - music, laughter, the occasional theatrical gasp as some new "surprise" was revealed to the contestants. From my hammock, I watched the distant flicker of tiki torches and listened to the artificial excitement building.

Six weeks suddenly felt like an eternity. But I'd survived worse - I'd survived actually caring about things. This was just a temporary disruption to my carefully cultivated nothing.

I closed my eyes and focused on the gentle swaying of my hammock, trying to tune out the sounds of reality television being manufactured just yards from my home. Tomorrow, the actual competition would begin, and with it, undoubtedly, more disruptions to my peace.

But tonight, I had beer, a hammock, and a thousand dollars for five minutes of walking. By my standards, that was almost a productive day.
