Chapter 1: The Sound of Doing

There's a particular sound to purpose. It's unmistakable—the rhythmic, determined cadence of people who believe their actions matter. I've spent the last three years of my life avoiding that sound, crafting a lifestyle deliberately devoid of such offensive acoustics.

Which is why the voices and footsteps approaching my hammock were so irritating.

"Mr. Miles? Are you awake?" A woman's voice, professional but with the underlying tension of someone on a schedule.

I kept my eyes closed, hoping she might decide I was dead and leave me to decompose in peace.

"I know you can hear me." Footsteps on sand, closer now. "Your neighbor Mrs. Kahale said you'd be here, and that you'd pretend to be asleep."

Damn Mrs. Kahale and her helpful accuracy.

I opened one eye. The sun was directly overhead, which meant it was either noon or I'd slept for a full twenty-four hours again. Standing over me was a woman in her early thirties, wearing the universal uniform of people with clipboards and too many responsibilities: khaki pants, sensible shoes, and a polo shirt with a logo I didn't recognize.

"Madison Blackwell, location manager for Extreme Island Challenge." She extended a hand which I pointedly didn't take. "We spoke on the phone last week?"

"Did we?" I genuinely couldn't remember, but that wasn't unusual. Since moving to Kalakahua Island, I'd found that conversations, much like vegetables and regular exercise, were things I could happily live without.

She lowered her hand. "Yes. About using the path through your property for our production. You said, and I quote, 'If you pay me to go away, I'll go away even if I'm already gone.'"

That did sound like me.

"Right," I said, making no move to get out of my hammock. "And did you?"

"Did I what?"

"Pay me to go away."

"I sent the contract and first payment to your post office box three days ago." Her tone suggested she was already regretting this conversation. "Mr. Nakamura at the bar signed for it."

"Ah." Kip Nakamura owned The Last Post, Kalakahua's combination bar and post office. The arrangement made sense on an island with fewer than two hundred permanent residents, and it meant mail could be collected while drinking, which was basically the only reason I ever left my property. "Haven't picked up my mail in a while."

"It's been ten days, actually," came another voice, this one older and distinctly unimpressed. "And you're out of coffee, toilet paper, and anything resembling real food."

I sighed and opened both eyes. Mrs. Kealoha, my housekeeper (though "reluctant caretaker of a human disaster" would be more accurate), stood next to Madison, arms crossed over her floral-print dress. At sixty-something, with silver-streaked black hair always pulled into a practical bun, Mrs. Kealoha had been maintaining my grandfather's house long before I inherited it. Despite my irregular ability to pay her over the last year, she kept showing up three times a week, muttering disapprovingly in Hawaiian while ensuring I didn't die of neglect.

"I have beer," I pointed out.

"Beer is not food," Mrs. Kealoha replied with the weary patience of someone who'd had this exact conversation many times before. "And you need to pick up your mail. Leilani says there's a package from the mainland that's been sitting at The Post for a week. Probably those books you ordered."

I made a noncommittal noise. Getting out of my hammock before sunset violated my personal code of minimal effort, but Mrs. Kealoha had that look that meant she was calculating how many years she'd get for justifiable homicide.

Madison cleared her throat. "Mr. Miles, I just need a few minutes of your time to finalize the access details for our production. Our setup team arrives tomorrow, and we need to mark the path through your property to the beach."

I squinted at her. "I thought the point of paying me was so I wouldn't have to be involved."

"The payment is for access rights," she explained, with the forced calm of someone explaining something very simple to a particularly dense child. "We still need to discuss logistics, boundaries, and noise considerations."

"Noise?" I echoed, suddenly more alert. My carefully curated existence was built around three fundamental principles: minimal effort, maximum comfort, and absolute tranquility. "What kind of noise?"

"It's a television production, Mr. Miles. There will be some unavoidable noise during setup, filming, and breakdown." She consulted her clipboard. "We'll be filming for approximately two weeks, with setup beginning tomorrow."

Mrs. Kealoha made a sound that might have been a laugh. "This ought to be good."

I glared at her, which had all the effect of a flashlight beam on a brick wall. "I don't recall agreeing to noise."

"The contract specifically outlines standard production noise parameters. We've scheduled most of the louder activities between 9 AM and 7 PM to minimize disruption." Madison tilted her head. "Did you actually read the contract before agreeing?"

"I have a policy against reading anything that might require me to do something."

Mrs. Kealoha snorted. "That explains the stack of unpaid utility bills on your counter."

"Those are decorative," I said. "I'm creating an installation art piece about the futility of modern life."

Madison looked between us, clearly recalibrating her approach. "Mr. Miles, perhaps we could discuss this over coffee? I'm happy to address any concerns you have."

"He doesn't have any coffee," Mrs. Kealoha reminded her. "But I'm going to the store. I can bring some back if you're still here in an hour." She gave me a pointed look. "Which you should be, instead of hiding in your hammock like a teenager skipping school."

"I'm not hiding," I protested. "I'm conducting important hammock stress-testing research."

"Mm-hmm." She turned to Madison. "Good luck with this one. He used to find missing people for a living, now he can't find his own flip-flops." With that parting shot, she headed up the path toward my grandfather's old Jeep, which had somehow become hers despite technically belonging to me.

Madison's expression had shifted from professional patience to genuine curiosity. "You were a detective?"

"I was a lot of things. None of them stuck." I sighed and reluctantly began the complex process of extracting myself from the hammock. This involved a series of undignified movements that always made me look like a turtle trying to right itself. After a moment of awkward flailing, I managed to stand, immediately searching for my flip-flops in the sand.

One was exactly where I'd left it. The other was nowhere to be seen.

"Looking for this?" Madison asked, pointing to a blue flip-flop hanging inexplicably from a low branch of the nearest palm tree.

I stared at it. "How did it even get up there? I fell asleep with it on my foot."

"The mystery of the migrating footwear," she said with a small smile. "Quite the case for a detective."

"Former detective," I corrected, retrieving the wayward flip-flop. "And not a very good one, which is why I'm here rather than solving crimes in Chicago."

That wasn't entirely accurate. I was here because my grandfather had unexpectedly left me his beach house when he died three years ago, offering an escape hatch from a career I'd grown to hate. I'd been a mediocre detective at best, with just enough observational skills to solve simple cases but none of the political savvy to advance. After a particularly disastrous case involving a senator's missing daughter (who, as it turned out, hadn't wanted to be found), I'd been on the verge of being fired when my grandfather's lawyer called with news of my inheritance.

I'd been on the island within a week, leaving behind nothing I cared to remember.

"Well, former detective," Madison said, "I still need ten minutes of your time to go over these access points."

I glanced longingly back at my hammock, then at her determined expression, and decided this was one of those rare battles not worth fighting. "Fine. Let's go up to the house. But I'm not offering you anything, because as my delightful housekeeper pointed out, I don't have anything."

"I brought my own water," she said, producing a metal bottle from a small backpack. "I come prepared."

The walk to the house took exactly seventy-four steps—I'd counted them many times during late-night hammock returns after too much rum at The Last Post. My grandfather's house wasn't large, just a simple single-story structure with a wide porch facing the ocean. The tropical hardwood exterior had weathered to a silvery gray that blended with the surrounding palms and beach vegetation. It needed a new roof, the steps to the porch sagged in the middle, and the windows perpetually stuck halfway open due to salt and humidity, but it was mine—the only thing I'd ever owned outright.

I led Madison onto the porch, gesturing vaguely toward one of the mismatched chairs my grandfather had collected over the years. Each had a story he'd been eager to tell—the rocking chair from a famous shipwreck, the Adirondack salvaged from an abandoned resort, the wicker monstrosity supposedly owned by some Hawaiian prince. I'd listened to the stories exactly once, nodding in all the right places while wondering how soon I could get back to doing absolutely nothing.

Now I wished I'd paid more attention. Not because I cared about the chairs, but because those stories were the last connections to a man who, despite my complete lack of achievement, had thought enough of me to leave me his paradise.

Madison sat in the Adirondack, arranging her clipboard and producing a map of the surrounding area. "So, as discussed in the contract, we need access from the main road, through your property, to the beach area here." She indicated a path on the map. "We'll be setting up our main production area just beyond your property line, but crew and equipment will need to use this path daily."

I leaned against the porch railing, noting that it wobbled more than the last time I'd tested it. Another maintenance task I was purposefully ignoring. "And this pays for my existence how, exactly?"

"The contract specifies a location fee of $5,000 for the two-week shoot, plus an additional $500 per day if we need to extend." She looked up from her clipboard. "Which is quite generous for simple path access."

It was, in fact, suspiciously generous. Even in my deliberately unambitious lifestyle, I recognized when numbers didn't add up. Finding lost pets and missing jewelry for island residents—my only source of income beyond my rapidly dwindling savings—typically earned me between twenty and a hundred dollars per "case," depending on the client's finances and my level of interest. Five thousand for people to walk along a path I never used seemed excessive.

My dormant detective instincts stirred reluctantly. "What are you actually filming?"

Madison hesitated just long enough for me to know whatever came next wasn't the whole truth. "It's a Japanese reality competition show. Contestants complete challenges around the island for prizes."

"And these challenges are...?"

"Standard reality TV fare. Physical obstacles, team competitions, skill tests." She smiled blandly. "Nothing that would impact your property directly."

I might have been a subpar detective, but I could still recognize evasion. "So why the excessive payment for a path?"

She sighed, apparently deciding on a different approach. "Mr. Miles, I'll be direct. Your property is not just convenient for path access—it's visible in the background of many of our planned shots. The fee covers potential disruption, visual inclusion in the production, and..." she hesitated again, "the understanding that a Japanese reality show production is not the quietest of neighbors."

"How not quiet are we talking?"

"The show format includes enthusiastic contestant reactions, a very animated host, music cues, and some special effects." She delivered this information with the careful neutrality of someone describing a minor nuclear disaster as a 'thermal event.' "We'll provide noise-canceling headphones if that would help."

I stared at her. "You're paying me $5,000 to destroy my peace and quiet."

"We're paying you $5,000 to temporarily transform your peace and quiet into something more...dynamic."

Before I could respond to this corporate doublespeak masterpiece, the sound of a vehicle pulling up interrupted us. A moment later, Mrs. Kealoha appeared, carrying several bags of groceries and wearing an expression that dared me to not help her.

I pushed away from the railing and took the heaviest bags, following her inside. The interior of the house was as simple as the exterior—one large main room combining living and dining areas, a small kitchen along one wall, a hallway leading to two bedrooms and a bathroom. The furnishings were all my grandfather's: solid, practical pieces that had withstood decades of island humidity and his notoriously absent-minded maintenance.

Mrs. Kealoha began unpacking groceries with brutal efficiency, each item placed with a force that communicated exactly how she felt about my empty refrigerator. "Your mail is in the blue bag," she said, not looking up. "The bills are on top. Kip says if you don't pay your tab by Friday, he's cutting you off."

"Kip threatens that every month," I said, rummaging through the bag to find anything that wasn't a bill or junk mail. "He knows I'll pay eventually."

"Mr. Nakamura has the patience of a saint," she muttered. "Unlike some of us."

Madison had followed us inside and was standing awkwardly by the door, clipboard clutched to her chest like a shield against the domestic tension. Mrs. Kealoha noticed her and immediately shifted into the formal politeness she reserved for people who weren't me.

"Would you like some iced tea?" she offered. "I brought fresh lemons."

"That would be lovely, thank you," Madison replied with evident relief at this oasis of normal social interaction.

Mrs. Kealoha busied herself making tea while I continued sorting through mail. Buried beneath the bills and circulars was a thick envelope with the production company logo that matched Madison's polo shirt. I opened it and skimmed the contents—a detailed contract that I definitely should have read before agreeing to anything, and a check for $2,500, apparently the first half of my payment.

At the sight of actual money, my perspective shifted slightly. Five thousand dollars wouldn't last forever, but it would cover several months of minimal existence, replenish my emergency fund, and—most importantly—allow me to pay Mrs. Kealoha the back wages I owed her.

I looked up to find both women watching me: Madison with hopeful professionalism, Mrs. Kealoha with knowing resignation.

"How long did you say this production would last?" I asked Madison.

"Two weeks of filming, with a few days of setup before and breakdown after. Approximately three weeks total."

I glanced at Mrs. Kealoha, who raised an eyebrow in a way that clearly communicated, "Your choice, but remember who buys your groceries when you're too lazy to do it yourself."

The check in my hand represented more money than I'd earned in the past six months of half-hearted detective work. Cases like finding Mrs. Kahale's perpetually wandering cat or locating Vinny's daughter's missing bicycle for the fifth time barely covered my rum budget, let alone actual expenses.

"Fine," I said finally. "But I have conditions."

Madison visibly relaxed. "Of course. That's exactly what I wanted to discuss."

"No one enters my house. The path is for production use only—no wandering around my property. I want a schedule of the noisiest activities so I can plan to be elsewhere." I paused, trying to think of what else might preserve some small portion of my peace. "And I want your personal number to call when something inevitably goes wrong."

She nodded, already making notes. "Completely reasonable. I'll have a detailed schedule by tomorrow morning, and we'll mark the path clearly to ensure no one strays onto the rest of your property."

Mrs. Kealoha placed glasses of iced tea on the counter with a soft clink. "You should also ask for some of that craft service food," she suggested. "TV productions always have good snacks."

Madison smiled. "We can definitely arrange to include Mr. Miles in daily meals if he'd like."

"He would not like," I said firmly. "The whole point of my existence is minimal human interaction."

"Says the man who spent all day yesterday looking for Leilani's missing parrot," Mrs. Kealoha countered.

"That was different. The parrot knows my secrets and speaks English. I couldn't risk it talking to the wrong people."

Madison looked between us with the expression of someone witnessing an exotic tribal ritual. "We'll make food available," she said diplomatically, "and you can decide whether to partake."

We spent the next twenty minutes going through the logistics of the production. Despite my commitment to knowing as little as possible about anything requiring effort, I found myself asking detailed questions about filming schedules, crew size, and noise mitigation. Madison answered everything with efficient clarity, occasionally consulting her phone for specific details.

By the time she left, I had a much clearer picture of the chaos about to descend on my peaceful existence, and a growing suspicion that I'd agreed to something I would deeply regret.

Mrs. Kealoha watched from the porch as Madison walked back toward the main road, where a rental car waited. When she was out of earshot, my housekeeper turned to me.

"You know this is going to be a disaster, right?"

"Most things are," I agreed, pocketing the check. "But this one pays better than looking for Mrs. Palu's missing wedding ring that's always in her garden."

"Speaking of payments," she said pointedly.

I held up the check. "This goes to the bank tomorrow, and your back wages by Friday."

She nodded, satisfied. "Good. Because I wasn't joking about the groceries. You were down to beer and three very suspicious eggs."

"The eggs were an experiment in natural preservation techniques."

"They were a health hazard." She began gathering her things, preparing to leave. "I'll be back on Thursday. Try not to starve or get evicted before then."

"This is my house. I can't be evicted."

"No, but the bank can take it if you don't pay your property taxes." She fixed me with a stern look. "Which were due last month."

I waved the check again. "All bills will be paid. My brief career as a background extra in a Japanese game show will restore my financial solvency."

"Mm-hmm." Her tone suggested profound skepticism. "Just remember—when they start filming, don't wander around in your underwear. I don't need to see you on Japanese television."

"My exhibitionist days are behind me," I assured her solemnly.

She rolled her eyes and headed for the door. "Check the front step before you go to bed," she said over her shoulder. "I found another one of your flip-flops in the Kahales' yard this morning. It's like they're trying to escape."

After she left, I slouched onto the porch steps, contemplating the beach and the impending invasion of my solitude. The sun was beginning its descent toward the horizon, painting the waves with golden light. It was the kind of view real estate companies put on brochures, promising peace and tranquility to mainlanders with too much money and too little sense.

I'd found that peace here, or something close enough to it. Three years of deliberate nothing had almost erased the memory of who I'd been before—a mediocre detective with more failed cases than successful ones, a disappointment to the force and to myself. Here, expectations were so low that simply existing exceeded them.

Now a Japanese reality show threatened to disrupt even that minimal achievement.

I glanced down at the porch step and, sure enough, spotted a single flip-flop—not the one I was currently wearing, but its long-lost twin from a pair that had disappeared weeks ago. I picked it up, turning it over in my hand. The mystery of my migrating footwear remained unsolved, a case even more baffling than some I'd failed to crack in Chicago.

"At least I'm consistent," I murmured to no one in particular. "Still can't solve the simplest mysteries."

As if in response, a distant rumble of thunder rolled across the water. I looked up to see clouds gathering on the horizon—not close enough to worry about yet, but a promise of changes to come. Fitting, I supposed, for the disruption heading my way.

With a sigh, I set aside the prodigal flip-flop and headed inside to find something resembling dinner among the groceries Mrs. Kealoha had brought. Tomorrow would bring the beginning of the end of my perfect nothing, and I wanted to enjoy my last night of peace.

Even if that peace came with slightly judgmental grocery shopping and mysteriously mobile footwear.
