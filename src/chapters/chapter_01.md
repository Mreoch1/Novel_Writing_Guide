# Chapter 1: The Sound of Doing

Hammocks are perfect because they require zero effort. You don't make a bed that's already a bed. You don't fluff pillows that don't exist. You just lie there, suspended, like your entire existence - hanging in place, not really going anywhere.

This morning, like every morning for the past five years, I woke up because a yellow parrot screamed in my ear. I have no idea what kind of parrot it is. I could've looked it up years ago, but that would've required moving. The parrot shows up, makes noise, leaves. We have that in common.

"Morning, whatever," I muttered, not bothering to open my eyes yet. If you name something, you start caring about it. Caring leads to effort. Effort is the enemy.

I eventually shuffled through what some might generously call a "morning ritual" - a quick outdoor shower because indoor plumbing required maintenance, coffee brewed over a small camp stove, and whatever fruit happened to be within arm's reach of where I was standing. Today's breakfast: a mango that had conveniently fallen from a tree and rolled to a stop against my foot. Nature's delivery service.

I noticed fresh coconuts in my delivery box – Paco's twice-weekly drop-off. The kid had the perfect business model: I pay him an exorbitant monthly fee, and in return, he ensures I never have to go shopping, pick up mail, or interact with the general population of the island. Money well spent.

By 8:30, or maybe 9:15, or possibly 10:00 - who cares? - I was back in the hammock with a paperback I'd been reading for weeks. The same book I'd been reading for weeks before that, and might still be reading weeks from now. It was some detective novel. The pages were warped from getting wet during afternoon rain showers that I never bothered to avoid. Moving inside would've required... well, moving.

The morning passed as mornings should: like nothing was happening because nothing was. Perfect.

I heard the familiar clicking of flip-flops approaching, followed by a disapproving sniff. Leilani, my housekeeper, though that term drastically undersold her role as the reluctant manager of my existence.

"You're still in that hammock," she said. Not a question.

"I'm conserving energy," I replied without opening my eyes.

"For what?" Another non-question.

I didn't answer. We had this conversation twice a week. Leilani would come to clean a house that barely got dirty because I barely moved, and she would comment on my lifestyle choices while rearranging my few possessions according to a system only she understood.

"I'm changing your sheets," she announced.

"They don't need changing."

"If you could smell what I smell, you wouldn't say that."

I heard her enter my bungalow. Money doesn't buy happiness, but it does buy the services of people willing to handle all the tedious parts of staying alive while you focus on the important things, like perfecting the art of doing absolutely nothing.

At some point, the sun shifted enough to shine directly in my eyes. Rather than adjust the hammock or move to shade, I simply pulled my hat over my face and continued my expert level of doing absolutely nothing.

That was when I heard voices. Multiple voices.

Voices meant people. People meant expectations. Expectations meant having to exert energy avoiding those expectations.

I briefly considered pretending to be asleep, but my curiosity - the bane of perfect laziness - got the better of me. I lifted my hat just enough to squint toward the harbor.

The harbor, which normally held only Kip's sagging supply boat twice a week, now contained what appeared to be an entire fleet. Three gleaming white vessels that screamed "someone cares way too much about appearances," a barge loaded with equipment, and several smaller boats buzzing between them like they had places to be. Tragic.

This wasn't the occasional wealthy tourist who anchored for a night before realizing our island offered exactly zero interesting activities besides watching paint peel. This was... organized. Organization is the first sign of unwanted effort.

I dropped my hat back over my face and considered my options. Option one: do nothing and hope whatever was happening would happen somewhere else. Option two: find out what was happening so I could more effectively avoid it later.

Option one was clearly superior, but my hammock was now in direct sunlight, and I'd eventually need more rum, which meant a trip to Kip's place. I sighed deeply. Some days the universe just won't let you be perfectly useless.

"Today is laundry day," Leilani announced, emerging from my bungalow with a small bag of clothes. "You need to buy more shirts. These are falling apart."

"Buying things requires decisions. Decisions require thought."

"Heaven forbid," she muttered. "I'll drop these at Vinny's. You remember it's Thursday? Your standing appointment?"

I'd almost forgotten. Thursday was my weekly visit to Vinny's air-conditioned laundromat, the only place on the island that maintained a civilized temperature. I'd sit in his back office, drink his cold beer, and listen to him rant about fabric softener and his ex-wives while doing absolutely nothing. It was friendship in its purest form.

"I'll go later," I said.

"Your clothes will be done at two. Vinny says he has a new beer he wants you to try." Leilani knew exactly how to motivate me – minimal effort, maximum reward.

With the minimum movement necessary, I rolled out of the hammock and landed upright, a skill perfected through years of practice. I slid my feet into flip-flops - the only footwear I owned - and began the walk to Tiki & Mail, taking the longest, least populated route possible.

Twenty-three minutes later (I only know because the church bell rang while I was walking), I arrived to find the bar's small deck crowded with excited people. Excited people are the worst kind of people. They have expectations.

The bar/post office functioned as the island's information hub, mainly because Kip was too lazy to separate the two businesses he'd accidentally acquired. Today it seemed everyone was talking at once, their voices overlapping in an anxious jumble.

"...biggest opportunity the island's ever had..."
"...celebrities, actual celebrities..."
"...filming for six whole weeks..."
"...think about the exposure..."

Through the crowd, I spotted Paco, who was already deep in conversation with someone holding a clipboard. The kid had an uncanny ability to sniff out business opportunities. Whatever was happening, he'd find a way to profit from it while doing the absolute minimum necessary.

I slipped past humanity's enthusiastic representatives and found my usual spot at the bar - the stool with the wobble that everyone else avoided. The wobble meant no one would try to take it if I got up, which meant I never had to worry about where to sit. Effort elimination at work.

Kip spotted me and made his way over. As the owner of Tiki & Mail, he was the closest thing the island had to a functional authority figure. He was also the closest thing I had to a friend, mainly because he knew better than to expect me to remember his birthday or ask about his day.

He placed a coconut in front of me - already opened, with a straw sticking out. It contained what we'd designated a "Lazy Sunrise" the first time he'd made it: coconut water, local rum, and whatever fruit juice Kip had that wouldn't require him to open a new container. The contents changed daily, but the essential quality - minimal effort - remained consistent.

"Bad news for you," Kip said, leaning against the bar. He had the look of someone who'd escaped from a life of caring too much and was determined to care just the minimum amount necessary. His bartending uniform consisted of board shorts and Hawaiian shirts so faded they were practically white.

"Define bad," I said after a long sip. Today's Lazy Sunrise tasted vaguely of pineapple, or maybe papaya. Who cares?

"Remember how I suggested this place would be perfect for one of those survival shows?"

"No. That would require remembering things. I'm opposed to that on principle."

Kip shrugged. "Well, it's happening anyway. 'Survival Island: Celebrity Redemption' is filming their next season here. Starting next week."

I took a very long drink, then closed my eyes. "By 'here,' I hope you mean some other island that requires them to leave this one entirely."

"I mean here. This island. The island we're currently existing on."

I opened one eye. "How did this happen?"

"Location scout found us three months ago. Pretended to be a travel writer." Kip wiped down an already clean section of bar, a nervous habit from his former life. "Council voted on it last week."

"Let me guess, I was supposed to be at that meeting."

"You're technically still on the council since no one's willing to do the paperwork to remove you."

"That's the beauty of bureaucracy. Laziness is baked in." I drained the rest of my drink. "How bad will this be? Scale of one to ten, one being 'slightly annoying' and ten being 'I need to find a new island.'"

Kip hesitated, which told me everything.

"They're bringing in twelve celebrities—"

"Nope."

"—and a full production crew—"

"Nope."

"—and they're setting up the main camp on North Beach—"

"That's like a twenty-minute walk from my place. Too close." I rarely raised my voice, but this seemed like a valid exception.

"About that..." Kip suddenly became very interested in wiping invisible spots off a glass. "They, uh, they want to use your beach area for one of the challenge locations."

I stared at him.

"The contracts are already signed," Kip said with a shrug. "They're paying well, though. Really well. Everyone gets a cut. Including you, if you agree to let them use your beach occasionally."

"And if I don't agree?"

"They'll just use the public part that starts five steps from your porch."

I noticed Paco had maneuvered himself closer to our conversation, no doubt calculating how many deliveries he could score from a television production. Traitor.

I closed my eyes again, trying to imagine how I could continue my rigorous schedule of doing absolutely nothing while surrounded by cameras, cables, and worst of all, people with purpose.

"When do they arrive?" I asked, already knowing I wouldn't like the answer.

"The advance team is here now. Those boats in the harbor. The celebrities arrive Monday. First episode films Tuesday."

Five days. I had five days of peace left.

"I need another drink," I said. "And a second hammock location where no one will find me."

"I know all the hidden spots," Paco chimed in, appearing beside me like he'd materialized from thin air. "I can set up a backup hammock somewhere secret. Extra fee, of course."

"Of course," I sighed. "Add it to my tab."

As Kip reached for the rum, the door burst open with enough force to dislodge years of accumulated dust from the frame. A woman with a clipboard and a headset strode in like she was perpetually walking against a deadline. Behind her trailed three identically stressed assistants, each carrying tablets and expressions of carefully managed panic.

"Hi there!" She spoke with the manufactured enthusiasm of someone who'd snorted pure optimism. "I'm Madison, location manager for 'Survival Island.' Which one of you is—" she consulted her tablet with a perfectly manicured fingernail, "—Miles Thorne? We're so excited about the private beach setup!"

Everyone in the bar turned to look at me. I didn't bother to sink lower on my stool. That would require effort. I just closed my eyes, hoping that like a T-Rex, she might be unable to see me if I didn't move.

Paco, however, extended his hand to Madison with a grin. "I'm his logistics manager. We should talk."

Before I could object to this self-promotion, Madison exclaimed, "Oh! There you are! Perfect!" Her voice somehow got even perkier, defying the laws of sound. "Let's chat about your beachfront. We're thinking tiki torches, challenge platforms, maybe a small confessional area..."

As she approached, clipboard extended like a weapon, I experienced a vivid flashback to exactly why I'd escaped civilization in the first place.

"Kip," I said quietly, refusing to open my eyes. "Just pour the rum directly into my mouth."

In the corner, I heard Vinny's distinctive Jersey accent as he cornered one of Madison's assistants. "You're gonna need a laundry service for all those contestants. Sweat, mud, tropical stains—I've seen it all, kid."

It was going to be a long six weeks.
