Chapter 2: The Calm Before the Storm

I spent Friday hiding. 

Not actively hiding, of course - that would require effort. I simply relocated to my secondary hammock spot deeper in the trees behind my bungalow. The location offered three strategic advantages: it couldn't be seen from the beach, it was shaded for 82% of daylight hours, and most importantly, the cell signal disappeared completely once you passed a certain twisted palm tree.

"This is a temporary setback," I told myself, swaying gently as a breeze moved through the trees. "They'll film their show, realize this island lacks the necessary drama for good television, and leave early."

The yellow parrot landed on a nearby branch and tilted its head skeptically.

"Don't look at me like that," I muttered. "I know things about television production."

I didn't know things about television production.

What I did know was that, in my previous life, I'd produced enough financial disasters to recognize one forming. Reality shows needed drama. Our island's primary export was the absence of drama. The math didn't work.

I dozed off with this comforting thought, only to be awakened by the distinctive sound of Paco's flip-flops crushing leaves.

"Mr. Miles," he called, apparently having appointed himself my personal herald. "I've set up your escape hammock at the location we discussed."

I hadn't discussed any location with him. I'd simply paid him to find somewhere so remote that even he wouldn't bother me there.

"Great," I responded without opening my eyes.

"And the TV people want to meet with you. They sent this." He thrust a glossy folder toward me that practically screamed "corporate marketing."

I ignored the folder until it became clear Paco wasn't leaving without a response. With a sigh that expressed my deep philosophical objection to the entire situation, I accepted the folder and flipped it open.

Inside was a "welcome packet" for "island partners" of "Survival Island: Celebrity Redemption." The title page featured twelve absurdly attractive people in carefully distressed clothing, looking simultaneously determined and vulnerable. Below them, in font so large it was practically shouting: "WHERE FAME MEETS FEAR - AND ONLY REDEMPTION REMAINS."

"Who writes this garbage?" I asked the air.

"They want to meet tomorrow at 10 AM," Paco continued. "At your beach. The location manager says it's non-negotiable."

Non-negotiable. A concept invented by people who think their urgency should automatically become everyone else's problem.

"Tell them I've been called away on urgent business."

"On an island with one boat that leaves once a week?"

"Tell them I'm dead."

"They've seen you walking around."

"Fine. Tell them I only take meetings after noon, and only if they bring their own chairs, shade structures, and refreshments." I closed my eyes again, considering the conversation finished.

Paco shifted his weight, flip-flops creating that irritating rubbing sound against his heels. "They're paying triple rate for any locals who help with the production."

Ah. So that was his angle.

"You want me to cooperate so you can get a temporary job carrying equipment for overpaid executives?"

He shrugged. "I'm just saying, money is money."

"Money is decidedly not just money," I replied. "Money is the world's most efficient tool for converting freedom into obligation." I waved him away. "Go. Negotiate on my behalf. Tell them I'll appear at noon, for no longer than twenty minutes, and they can't bring more than three people."

After Paco left, I closed my eyes again and tried to recapture the perfect nothingness I'd been cultivating. But my mind kept returning to the glossy folder now lying on the ground beside my hammock.

Curiosity - the death of tranquility.

With a grunt of annoyance at myself, I picked up the folder again and flipped past the ridiculous cover.

The first page contained headshots and bios of the "celebrities" who would be "surviving" on our island. I recognized maybe two of them - a former sitcom actor and a pop star who'd had that one song about heartbreak or empowerment or whatever. The rest were identified as "influencer," "reality star," and "entrepreneur/model," occupations that hadn't existed when I'd escaped civilization.

The second page contained a "shooting schedule" with confidentiality warnings all over it. Apparently, the celebrities would be divided into two "tribes" (we were now a tribal island, wonderful) and would compete in challenges for rewards and immunity. Every three days, someone would be voted off until only one remained.

The whole thing was scheduled for exactly six weeks. Forty-two days of cameras, lighting equipment, production assistants, and the sound of people trying very, very hard.

I closed the folder and tossed it aside.

"I need rum," I announced to no one.

Making the executive decision that even my laziness had limits – specifically, the limit was forced sobriety while a reality show invaded my beach – I trudged back to my bungalow to retrieve my emergency funds.

My living quarters were exactly as Leilani had arranged them that morning: bed made with military precision, three shirts hung in the closet, single toothbrush aligned perfectly in its holder. The woman had standards I couldn't begin to comprehend, but I appreciated her dedication to maintaining them on my behalf.

I grabbed my "wallet" – a waterproof pouch containing enough cash to handle my minimal needs – and headed toward Tiki & Mail. The walk gave me time to consider my options.

Option one: Endure. Stay in my bungalow, use the backup hammock locations, and wait for this nightmare to end.

Option two: Temporarily relocate to the other side of the island, where Vinny's cousin had a fishing shack he never used.

Option three: Improvise a raft and drift to the next island. Possibly die at sea. Pro: no more reality shows. Con: effort required, plus potential death.

By the time I reached Tiki & Mail, I'd settled on option one with elements of option two as needed. The bar was uncharacteristically busy, filled with the advance team and various islanders pretending they weren't desperately eavesdropping.

I slipped past the crowd to my wobble stool, which thankfully remained unoccupied. Kip spotted me and brought over a Lazy Sunrise without being asked.

"They're taking over," I observed.

Kip nodded solemnly. "Contract says they get exclusive use of the bar for certain events. I'm making enough to fix the roof, though."

"Finally," I said. The roof had been leaking for three rainy seasons. During downpours, we simply moved to whichever seats remained dry, gradually condensing into a small circle of relative comfort as the puddles expanded.

"Your boy Paco is making out like a bandit," Kip noted, gesturing toward the back corner.

I turned to see Paco holding court with three production assistants, a map of the island spread before them. He was pointing to various locations and apparently negotiating rates for his "local expertise and logistics management services."

"He's not my boy," I clarified. "He's more like a remora that's attached itself to my general existence."

"A useful remora. He negotiated your beach usage fee up thirty percent from their initial offer."

I raised an eyebrow. "When did he become my agent?"

"When he realized he could take a percentage." Kip slid a piece of paper across the bar. "This is what they're offering for limited use of your beach area twice a week for the challenges. Plus a non-disclosure agreement."

The number on the paper was substantial enough to make even me reconsider my opposition to the entire enterprise.

"And if I sign this, I commit to...?"

"Staying out of the way during filming, not revealing any results before the show airs, and giving them exclusive rights to any footage that includes your property." Kip shrugged. "Standard TV stuff."

"What if I counter with a demand that they finish filming in four weeks instead of six?"

"They'll say no and film on the public portion of the beach, which starts approximately five steps from your hammock."

I sighed. "They really have me cornered, don't they?"

"Like a sloth in a shoe store."

I considered my options again, took a long drink, and gestured for a pen. "Fine. But I want it in writing that they can't film before 10 AM or after 6 PM, can't enter my bungalow for any reason, and must provide me with a weekly supply of whatever alcohol they're giving the production crew."

Kip smiled. "Already added those stipulations. Page two."

I signed without reading further. Legal documents were for people who cared about consequences.

Just as I was finishing my drink and contemplating whether getting another would require too much effort, the door opened and in walked a man who could only be described as aggressively well-dressed for island life. His linen shirt was too crisp, his chinos too perfectly rolled at the ankles, his loafers too clean. Even his salt-and-pepper stubble looked like it had been applied by a professional.

He scanned the room like a predator, spotted me, and smiled with too many teeth.

"Miles Thorne," he said, approaching with an extended hand. "I'm Devin Clarke, executive producer. I believe we have a meeting scheduled for tomorrow, but since you're here..."

I stared at his hand until he awkwardly lowered it.

"I've signed your paper," I said. "Isn't that enough?"

"We like to maintain good relationships with all our location partners," he said, smile never wavering. "And your property is particularly valuable to us. Did you know you own the only private beach on the island that faces west? Perfect golden hour lighting."

"I bought it because it was the furthest from the ferry dock," I replied.

Devin laughed like I'd made a deliberate joke. "Well, we're thrilled to be working with you. I want to personally assure you that we'll respect your privacy as much as possible."

"Define 'as much as possible.'"

His smile tightened almost imperceptibly. "We're a television production. We have certain needs."

"And I'm a hermit. I have certain needs too. Specifically, the need to be left alone."

"Of course, of course." He gestured vaguely. "We'll be in and out before you know it. You'll hardly notice us."

I looked pointedly at his pristine outfit. "I notice you right now, and you're just one person."

Another laugh, more strained this time. "Well, I should let you get back to your... whatever you were doing. Looking forward to a productive partnership."

As he walked away, I turned back to Kip. "I'm going to need a lot more rum."

"Already ordered extra," he assured me. "Arrives on Monday's boat."

"Good man."

I finished my drink and considered my next move. My laundry would be done at Vinny's, which meant I'd have clean clothes for the coming apocalypse. Small victories.

As I was leaving, Paco intercepted me at the door. "Mr. Miles, I've been appointed as your official production liaison!"

"By whom?"

"By me. I told them I handle all your affairs."

"The only affair I want handled is my affair of being left alone."

Paco grinned, undeterred. "They're paying me to make sure you're happy. So technically, you can tell me to make them leave you alone, and I get paid either way."

I had to admit, the kid had hustle. Misguided hustle that involved actual effort, but hustle nonetheless.

"Fine. Liaise away. First instruction: tell them to send all communications through you, not directly to me."

"Already done," he said proudly. "Also, they want to do a preliminary interview with you for background material. I scheduled it for never."

Despite myself, I almost smiled. "Good. Now go away."

As I walked back to my bungalow, I noticed new activity at the harbor. More boats had arrived, and people were unloading equipment onto the dock. Large cases with wheels, lighting stands, and what appeared to be an entire kitchen in separate components.

This was really happening.

When I reached my porch, I found a gift basket waiting with a note: "From your friends at Survival Island Productions! We're so excited to work with you!"

Inside was a baseball cap with the show's logo, a water bottle (also with the logo), and a bag of trail mix that had undoubtedly crossed an ocean to reach me.

I tossed the basket aside and collapsed into my hammock, staring up at the gradually darkening sky. The first stars were appearing, distant pinpricks in the deepening blue.

For five years, I'd perfected the art of doing nothing. I'd eliminated obligations, stripped away responsibilities, and curated an existence based entirely on minimal effort and maximum peace.

Now, a hurricane of activity was about to make landfall on my carefully constructed nothingness.

I closed my eyes and focused on the gentle swaying of the hammock, trying to store up tranquility like a squirrel hoarding nuts for winter.

Monday would arrive soon enough.
