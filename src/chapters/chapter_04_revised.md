Chapter 4: The First Challenge

The morning of the first challenge dawned with the particular cruelty reserved for days when you desperately need more sleep. I'd spent most of the night awake, listening to the production crew's "final preparations," which sounded suspiciously like a construction site being operated by caffeinated squirrels.

When I finally gave up on sleep around 5:30 AM, I discovered that both of my flip-flops had disappeared overnight. This wasn't particularly surprising—their escape attempts had become more coordinated lately—but it was inconvenient. I rummaged through my collection of orphaned footwear and found a mismatched pair: one blue rubber flip-flop advertising a mainland beer brand, and one leather sandal that had mysteriously appeared on my porch last month.

"If you two run away together, I'm walking barefoot forever," I informed them as I slipped them on. They didn't respond, but I sensed mutinous intentions.

Outside, the beach had been transformed into something that would give an OSHA inspector nightmares. Inflatable platforms bobbed in the shallows, connected by what looked like deliberately unstable floating bridges. Various stations had been set up along the shore, each more garish than the last. The crown jewel was a towering structure festooned with Japanese characters and gigantic plastic squid tentacles that undulated in the morning breeze.

Several crew members were making final adjustments under the watchful eye of Devin Clarke, who was gesturing expressively while speaking into a headset. As I watched from my porch, Madison spotted me and approached with the determined stride of someone delivering bad news to a person known for shooting messengers.

"Good morning, Mr. Miles," she called with forced cheer. "Beautiful day for our first challenge!"

"It's 5:30 in the morning," I replied. "No day is beautiful before coffee."

She held up a stainless steel travel mug. "Peace offering. Double espresso with a splash of coconut milk."

I accepted it suspiciously. "You're being uncharacteristically considerate. What fresh hell awaits me today?"

Madison sighed, dropping the professional smile. "There's been a slight change of plans. The Japanese network wants more... local color."

"Define 'local color' in a way that doesn't involve me doing anything."

"They want to include more shots of the surrounding area, including—" she hesitated, clearly choosing her words carefully, "—some establishing footage of your house."

I took a long sip of coffee, which was annoyingly excellent. "My house is off-limits. It's in the contract."

"I know, and I've explained that. We've compromised by agreeing to shoot only from the beach, with your house visible in the background." She produced her clipboard, ever-present like an extra appendage. "But I wanted to warn you that there will be cameras pointed in this general direction during filming."

"So I should wear pants today. Noted."

"That would be appreciated." She glanced at her watch. "The contestants will be arriving in about an hour for the opening ceremony. The actual challenge begins at nine. If you're planning to be elsewhere today, now would be a good time to depart."

I considered my options. Hiding out at The Last Post was tempting, but that would mean missing the spectacle that was about to unfold—and despite my commitment to doing nothing, I had to admit a morbid curiosity about what exactly a Japanese game show challenge entailed.

"I think I'll observe from a safe distance," I said. "For security purposes."

Madison raised an eyebrow. "Security purposes."

"I need to ensure no one trespasses on my property. Also, I want to see adults dressed as sea creatures humiliate themselves."

A hint of a genuine smile escaped her professional facade. "It should be quite a show. Just stay clear of the main camera lines, please. Yuki keeps telling the director that you're the 'mystic hermit spirit of the island,' and he's getting increasingly interested in including you as a recurring element."

"Tell Yuki I'm the 'irritable recluse who knows seventeen ways to file a lawsuit' instead."

"I'll translate that creatively." Madison handed me a laminated card with the day's schedule. "Here's the timing for everything. The loudest segments are highlighted in orange. I've also included the craft service location, just in case you get hungry."

I pocketed the schedule, oddly touched by her thoughtfulness despite my determination to remain annoyed at the entire production. "Thanks for the coffee."

She nodded and returned to the controlled chaos on the beach, leaving me to contemplate my observation strategy. My porch offered a clear view but felt too exposed. The cluster of palm trees near the property line would provide better concealment while still allowing me to see the proceedings.

I retreated inside to gather essentials for a day of strategic surveillance: a beach chair, a small cooler with water and beer, my least ostentatious hat, and a pair of binoculars I occasionally used for bird watching (though primarily for making sure visitors to my beach were far enough away to ignore).

As I was setting up my observation post, Mrs. Kealoha arrived, earlier than her usual Thursday visit. She took one look at my surveillance equipment and rolled her eyes.

"Very subtle," she said, setting down a bag of groceries beside my chair. "Why not just put up a sign that says 'suspicious hermit watching you'?"

"I'm ensuring the safety of my property."

"You're being nosy." She peered toward the beach. "Though I can't blame you. Leilani says the contestants are all famous, or at least famous-adjacent."

"You're here earlier than usual," I observed, unpacking the groceries to find she'd brought an assortment of breakfast items, including still-warm malasadas from the island's only bakery.

"I figured you'd need actual food to sustain your spying operation." She handed me a malasada dusted with coconut sugar. "Also, I wanted to see the show."

I bit into the warm pastry, momentarily transported to a state of sugary bliss. "Admit it, you're as curious as I am."

"The difference is I don't pretend I'm too cool to care." She settled onto the sand beside my chair with the ease of someone half her age. "From what Paco says, these contestants are either going to be entertainingly terrible or surprisingly good, with nothing in between."

We didn't have to wait long for the entertainment to begin. Around 6:30, a convoy of sleek black SUVs pulled up to the beach access road, and the contestants emerged in coordinated athleisure wear bearing the show's logo—a cartoon squid wearing a crown.

From our vantage point, we could see the production team greeting them with the manufactured enthusiasm of people paid to pretend that waking up at dawn to film adults in squid costumes was the epitome of career success.

"That's Tiffany Blair," Mrs. Kealoha whispered, pointing to a slender blonde woman gesturing dramatically as she spoke to Devin. "She was in that girl group—what were they called? The Dazzlers? My granddaughter had all their posters when she was thirteen."

"The Bedazzlers," I corrected, surprising myself. At Mrs. Kealoha's raised eyebrow, I shrugged. "I was a detective. Useless trivia sticks with me."

"And that one's Bryson something—fitness influencer. Has millions of followers watching him lift things and drink protein shakes." She squinted at the muscular man currently doing stretches on the beach. "Seems like a lot of attention for basic human movement."

I scanned the group, my gaze landing on the dark-haired woman I'd noticed during their arrival yesterday. Unlike the others, who were talking animatedly and striking poses whenever a camera pointed their way, she was quietly observing the set, taking in the obstacle course with what looked like tactical assessment.

"That's Alessandra Rossi," Mrs. Kealoha supplied before I could ask. "European actress. Does art films, I think. Paco says she's only doing this to fund her next movie."

"She seems... different from the others."

"Less desperate, you mean?" Mrs. Kealoha snorted. "Low bar."

As we watched, a small commotion erupted near the main platform. A Japanese man in an impeccably tailored suit had arrived, accompanied by an entourage of assistants. Even from a distance, his energy was palpable—he moved with the confident swagger of someone accustomed to being the center of attention.

"That must be the host," I said. "What was his name? Takashi?"

"Takashi Yamamoto," Mrs. Kealoha confirmed. "Famous in Japan, apparently. Known for his catchphrase, which Paco says translates roughly to 'Embrace the glorious failure!'"

"Charming."

Takashi was greeting each contestant with elaborate enthusiasm, accompanied by Yuki, who was attempting to translate his rapid-fire Japanese. Even from our distance, it was clear her translations were creative at best.

"Honorable squid warriors!" we heard her announce. "Welcome to beach of destiny where ocean spirits judge your worthiness through trials of most ridiculous dignity!"

The contestants nodded and smiled with the universal expression of people who had no idea what was being said but were being paid to look enthused about it.

"This is already better than cable," Mrs. Kealoha murmured, helping herself to another malasada.

For the next hour, we watched as the production team organized the contestants for what appeared to be promotional footage. They were positioned in various dramatic poses around the beach, with Takashi delivering impassioned speeches to the camera while gesturing at the obstacle course.

Around eight o'clock, the contestants were ushered into a tent set up near the production base camp. When they emerged thirty minutes later, I had to clamp a hand over my mouth to stifle a laugh.

Each was dressed in an elaborate sea creature costume that left their arms and legs free but transformed their torsos into cartoonish marine life. Tiffany Blair was a sparkly pink jellyfish, complete with tentacles that wobbled when she moved. Bryson the fitness influencer had been turned into a buff hammerhead shark, his sculpted abs still visible beneath the foam costume. A pair of identical twins were matching clownfish, and a stern-looking Japanese contestant had been dressed as an intimidating black octopus.

Alessandra Rossi emerged last, costumed as a sleek manta ray with impressive fabric "wings" extending from her arms. Unlike the others, who were alternately complaining or taking selfies in their outfits, she seemed to be analyzing how the costume might affect her movement in the challenges.

"Now I understand the excessive location fee," I said. "They're paying for my silence about whatever is about to happen."

Mrs. Kealoha chuckled. "Worth every penny."

The contestants were divided into two teams, identifiable by the colors of their costumes: Team Manta Ray (blue) and Team Squid (red). Each team huddled for a strategy session while production assistants made final adjustments to the course.

At precisely nine o'clock, a siren blared, and Takashi bounded onto the central platform, microphone in hand. He launched into what appeared to be an introduction of lung-busting enthusiasm, with Yuki attempting to keep pace with his energy if not his actual words.

"Welcome to first challenge of glorious humiliation!" she translated as Takashi gestured wildly at the obstacle course. "Today you will face Beach Battle of Splashy Doom, where dignity drowns but fame floats!"

The camera panned across the contestants, who were trying their best to look determined despite being dressed as aquatic caricatures. When the shot reached the edge of the frame, I realized with alarm that our observation post was potentially visible.

"Duck," I hissed to Mrs. Kealoha, sliding lower in my chair.

"Don't be ridiculous," she replied, but she shifted slightly behind a palm tree nonetheless. "They're not looking for middle-aged housekeepers and grumpy ex-detectives."

Once the introduction was complete, Takashi explained the challenge through Yuki's creative interpretation: "Teams must cross treacherous water path, complete tasks of strange flavor and embarrassing balance, then ring victory gong before opponents capture their team flag! Losing team faces elimination ceremony of sad reflection!"

The contestants nodded with the determined expressions of people who had signed very binding contracts.

"Begin with spirit of warrior octopus!" Takashi shouted, blowing an airhorn that sent nearby seagulls scattering in panic.

What followed was forty-five minutes of the most absurd physical comedy I'd ever witnessed. The contestants struggled across floating platforms that seemed designed specifically to dump them into the water at the most humiliating moments. Their sea creature costumes became waterlogged, making each movement more awkward than the last.

Team Manta Ray took an early lead, with Alessandra demonstrating surprising agility despite her cumbersome costume. She navigated the floating bridges with the precision of someone who had studied their instability patterns, calling out warnings to her teammates about which sections were most treacherous.

Meanwhile, Team Squid was in disarray. Tiffany Blair refused to get her hair wet, attempting to cross the entire course by delicately tip-toeing along the edges. The twins kept stopping to check if their matching makeup was still perfect, and Bryson the fitness influencer was more concerned with flexing for the camera than completing the challenges.

"This is the best thing I've ever seen," Mrs. Kealoha said, not bothering to hide her delight as Bryson belly-flopped into the water while attempting to demonstrate a handstand on a floating platform.

The course included several stations where contestants had to complete bizarre tasks: assembling puzzle pieces while standing on one foot, eating something that made several of them gag (though they were too far away for us to identify the culinary horror), and carrying water in increasingly ridiculous containers across unstable surfaces.

Throughout it all, Takashi provided manic commentary, with Yuki translating his rapid Japanese into English approximations that bore little resemblance to standard syntax.

"Jellyfish contestant embraces failure like old friend at airport!" she announced as Tiffany fell face-first into a pool of what appeared to be blue slime. "Very beautiful disaster!"

By the final stage, Team Manta Ray had pulled significantly ahead, largely due to Alessandra's unexpected competence and the team's willingness to follow her strategy. As they approached the victory gong, Takashi's commentary reached fever pitch, with Yuki's translation becoming increasingly abstract.

"Final moment approaches like hungry tiger at buffet of destiny! Team Manta Ray flies toward glory with wings of confident fish spirit!"

Alessandra reached the gong and struck it with dramatic flair, her team erupting in celebration as confetti cannons exploded along the beach. Team Squid arrived moments later, their expressions shifting from disappointment to camera-ready good sportsmanship with practiced ease.

"And so first challenge concludes with wet triumph!" Yuki translated as Takashi closed the segment. "Team Manta Ray earns immunity necklace of protection, while Team Squid must face elimination ceremony where one warrior returns to ocean of obscurity!"

The production team swarmed the contestants, handing out towels and water bottles while Devin consulted with Takashi about what appeared to be additional footage needed. The contestants were ushered back toward the tent, presumably to change out of their sopping wet costumes.

"Well," I said, leaning back in my chair, "that was simultaneously better and worse than I expected."

Mrs. Kealoha nodded, brushing sand from her dress as she stood. "I need to get to work, but I expect a full report on whatever happens this afternoon." She gathered her things and gave me a pointed look. "Try not to get caught spying. It ruins your mysterious hermit image."

"I'm maintaining crucial surveillance of my property line," I insisted.

"Mm-hmm." Her tone made it clear she wasn't buying it. "I left food in the refrigerator. Actual food, not just beer. Try to consume something with nutrients today."

After she left, I remained in my observation post, watching as the crew reset portions of the course and reviewed footage on monitors set up under a canopy. Madison was deep in conversation with Devin, occasionally gesturing toward my property with what appeared to be reassurance that the reclusive local wouldn't cause problems.

Around noon, the contestants re-emerged from the tent in their regular clothes, gathered for what looked like a post-challenge interview session. One by one, they sat in a chair facing the ocean and spoke to a camera, likely delivering the kind of reality TV confessionals that turned simple competitions into psychological warfare.

Tiffany Blair's session lasted nearly thirty minutes, complete with dramatic gestures and what appeared to be a few strategically timed tears. Bryson the fitness influencer spent most of his interview flexing subtly (and sometimes not so subtly) while explaining what looked like complicated strategy for future challenges.

When Alessandra's turn came, her interview was noticeably shorter. She spoke calmly, with minimal gestures, looking thoughtful rather than performative. There was something refreshingly genuine about her demeanor that stood out against the practiced drama of the others.

As the afternoon progressed, I found myself getting hungry, the breakfast malasadas long gone. According to Madison's schedule, the craft service table would be set up near the production tent until 4 PM. I debated the pros and cons of venturing into enemy territory for food, my pride warring with my growling stomach.

Hunger won. I stashed my surveillance equipment behind the palm trees and made my way down to the beach, trying to look like someone casually wandering through his own property rather than a spy infiltrating foreign soil.

The craft service table was impressive—a spread of sandwiches, fruit, snacks, and an array of beverages that would put most catered events to shame. I approached cautiously, nodding to a few crew members who glanced my way.

"Mr. Miles!" Madison spotted me from nearby. "I'm glad you decided to join us. Please, help yourself."

I grabbed a plate and loaded it with enough food to justify the social interaction required to obtain it. As I was debating between bottled water and some fancy coconut drink, a voice spoke beside me.

"So you're the mysterious beach hermit everyone's been talking about."

I turned to find Alessandra Rossi standing there, looking amused. Up close, she was even more striking—intelligent eyes, an air of calm confidence, and none of the desperate need for attention that seemed to radiate from the other contestants.

"I prefer 'reclusive property owner exercising his right to solitude,'" I replied. "But 'beach hermit' is catchier, I suppose."

"I watched you watching us all morning," she said, helping herself to a bottle of water. "Your observation post behind the palm trees isn't as stealthy as you might think."

I winced internally. So much for my surveillance skills. "I was monitoring my property line."

"Of course," she agreed, a smile playing at the corners of her mouth. "With binoculars. Very thorough property monitoring."

Before I could come up with a suitably dismissive response, Takashi bounded over, speaking rapidly in Japanese. Yuki hurried after him, translating his excited words into her unique version of English.

"Ah! Island hermit man joins our humble food gathering! Most fortuitous encounter!" She beamed at me. "Host Takashi wishes to express deep gratitude for allowing our squid warriors to battle near your sacred dwelling place."

"It's not sacred," I said. "It's just private."

Yuki conferred briefly with Takashi before responding. "Host says private spaces hold most sacred energy! Your solitude adds mysterious power to our show's spiritual journey!"

I glanced at Alessandra, who was clearly struggling not to laugh.

"Tell Mr. Takashi I'm happy to contribute mysterious energy as long as it doesn't require me to do or say anything," I said carefully.

After another rapid exchange in Japanese, Yuki nodded enthusiastically. "Host understands! Silent wisdom speaks louder than noisy ignorance! He respects your path of quiet observation."

With that philosophical pronouncement, Takashi bowed slightly, then dashed off to address some production crisis, Yuki trailing in his wake.

"Does any of that actually make sense in Japanese?" I asked Alessandra once they were out of earshot.

"Not even slightly," she replied. "I speak a little Japanese. What he actually said was something like, 'Oh, this is the grumpy neighbor Madison warned us about. Be polite so we don't get sued.'"

I couldn't help but laugh. "Well, that's refreshingly honest, at least."

"Honesty is in short supply around here." She nodded toward the other contestants, who were clustered together taking selfies for their social media accounts. "Everyone's playing a character, including me. It's just that my character happens to be 'person who wants to win the prize money without making a complete fool of herself.'"

"How's that strategy working out for you so far?"

"Well, I spent this morning dressed as a manta ray, so I'd say the 'not making a fool of myself' part is already compromised." She shrugged good-naturedly. "But my team won, so I'll count it as a partial success."

There was something refreshingly straightforward about her that made me temporarily forget my commitment to avoiding human interaction. "You were surprisingly good at the challenge," I observed. "Almost like you'd practiced."

"I watched old episodes of the show before coming," she admitted. "The obstacle patterns are similar season to season. The producers think viewers want tradition, but really they just don't want to redesign the courses."

My dormant detective instincts flared with appreciation for her thoroughness. "Smart preparation."

"Just basic research. I'm guessing that's something you understand, given your background."

I raised an eyebrow. "My background?"

"Mrs. Kealoha mentioned you were a detective when she brought breakfast this morning." At my surprised expression, she added, "We chatted while you were inside getting your binoculars. She's very proud of your past career, though she thinks you're wasting your skills finding lost pets."

"Mrs. Kealoha should focus less on my career choices and more on her gossip containment strategies," I muttered.

Alessandra smiled. "Don't worry. Your secret identity as the island's reluctant problem-solver is safe with me." She glanced at her watch. "I should get back. We have individual interviews all afternoon, and then tonight is the elimination ceremony."

"Where someone returns to the 'ocean of obscurity,' if I understood Yuki correctly."

"That's the general idea, though I expect the actual translation is more like 'gets voted off the show.'" She started to leave, then paused. "By the way, one of your flip-flops is on the roof of the production tent. I spotted it during the challenge. Might want to add that to your property monitoring report."

With that parting observation, she rejoined her fellow contestants, leaving me standing at the craft service table with a plate of food and the unsettling realization that I'd just had a conversation I didn't hate.

I located my wayward flip-flop on my way back to the house, requiring an awkward retrieval that involved borrowing a ladder from a bemused production assistant. How it had traveled from my porch to the top of a tent fifty yards away remained one of the island's enduring mysteries, alongside why anyone would voluntarily dress as a jellyfish on national television.

The afternoon passed with more filming—individual challenges for bonus points, interviews, and what appeared to be deliberately manufactured drama between contestants. I watched from the relative privacy of my porch, having abandoned any pretense of not being interested.

As evening approached, the beach was transformed again. Tiki torches were placed in a circle around a central platform where a large golden squid statue now stood. Crew members arranged ten stone pedestals in a semicircle facing the statue, and a dramatic throne was positioned for Takashi.

The elimination ceremony began at sunset, with contestants entering the "Circle of Squid Judgment" (according to Yuki's translation) one by one. They took their places on the stone pedestals as Takashi delivered what appeared to be a solemn assessment of their performance, punctuated by Yuki's increasingly metaphorical English versions.

"First challenge has separated true warriors from decorative seaweed!" she announced. "Team Manta Ray swims in victory current, while Team Squid faces the cutting knife of consequence!"

What followed was a complex voting procedure involving small wooden squid tokens, dramatic pauses, and music that seemed borrowed from a horror movie soundtrack. In the end, a male contestant I hadn't paid much attention to—identified as "Dex, social media pranking sensation"—was eliminated after receiving the most votes from his team.

The ceremony concluded with Takashi presenting Dex with a small wooden squid carving ("To remember your brief journey through waters of celebrity challenge!") and the eliminated contestant walking dramatically down the beach into the darkness, where I assumed a production van waited to return him to regular life.

By the time the cameras stopped rolling, night had fully fallen. The production team began breaking down the elimination set while contestants were escorted back to their accommodations. The beach gradually emptied, leaving only essential crew members securing equipment for the night.

I was about to head inside when I noticed a figure walking along the shoreline—Alessandra, now changed into casual clothes, her dark hair loose around her shoulders. She moved with the same deliberate calm I'd observed earlier, occasionally stopping to look out at the ocean.

As she approached my property line, I expected her to turn back. Instead, she glanced toward my porch and, seeing me there, changed course slightly to walk in my direction.

"Busy day?" she asked, stopping at the bottom of the steps.

"Exhausting," I replied. "All that professional lurking really takes it out of you."

She smiled. "Mind if I join you for a minute? I need a break from reality TV reality."

I hesitated, my instinct for solitude warring with unexpected curiosity. "I don't have much to offer in the way of refreshments. I'm a terrible host."

"Perfect. I've had enough hosting for one day." She climbed the steps and settled into one of the mismatched chairs, exhaling slowly as she looked out at the dark ocean. "It's peaceful here."

"It was until recently."

"Sorry about that. We'll be disrupting your tranquility for another thirteen days, give or take."

We sat in surprisingly comfortable silence for a few minutes, listening to the waves and the distant sounds of the production team packing up for the night.

"So," I said eventually, "what made you sign up for this particular form of public humiliation?"

"Money," she answered frankly. "I'm directing an independent film, and my funding fell through at the last minute. This pays enough to cover the budget gap."

"Seems like a high price to pay."

"Two weeks of looking ridiculous in exchange for making the film I've been working on for three years?" She shrugged. "Worth it. Besides, I'm good at games. I might actually win."

"Based on today's performance, I wouldn't bet against you."

She smiled at the compliment. "What about you? How does a detective end up as the island hermit?"

"Former detective," I corrected automatically. "And I wasn't a particularly good one. My grandfather left me this place, and it seemed like a good escape hatch from a career I was about to lose anyway."

"And now you find lost pets and missing flip-flops?"

"With varying degrees of success. The pets I usually find. The flip-flops have consistently outwitted me."

She laughed, a genuine sound without the performative quality the other contestants seemed to bring to every interaction. "Well, if you need detective backup on the flip-flop case, let me know. I've got thirteen more days here, assuming I don't get eliminated."

"I don't think you need to worry about that. You're the only one who seems to be taking the challenges seriously."

"That's because I'm the only one who's actually here for the prize money. The others are here for exposure, career rehabilitation, or because their managers told them it would make good content for their lifestyle brands." She made air quotes around the last phrase. "I just want to make my film."

"What's it about? The film."

"A woman who fakes her own death to escape her life, only to discover that disappearing is more complicated than she expected." She gave me a sidelong glance. "Something tells me you might relate to the theme."

Before I could respond, her phone buzzed. She checked it and sighed. "That's my cue. Production meeting to prep for tomorrow's challenge." She stood, stretching slightly. "Thanks for the moment of sanity."

"I've never been anyone's source of sanity before. It's disconcerting."

"Everything's relative. Compared to a reality show production, even a reclusive ex-detective with migrating footwear is a beacon of normalcy." She started down the steps, then turned back. "Same time tomorrow? After the challenge?"

The question caught me off guard. So did my answer.

"I'll be here. I'm always here. That's kind of my whole thing."

She smiled. "Good night, Detective Miles."

"Just Miles," I called after her.

"We'll see," she replied, already walking away along the moonlit beach.

I watched until she disappeared into the darkness, trying to identify the unfamiliar sensation in my chest. It took me a moment to recognize it as something dangerously close to interest in another human being—a condition I'd worked diligently to avoid for the past three years.

"This is going to be problematic," I muttered to myself.

As if in agreement, my remaining flip-flop chose that moment to slide off my foot and tumble down the porch steps, landing in almost the exact spot where Alessandra had stood.

I stared at it for a long moment, then sighed and went inside, leaving it where it fell. Some battles weren't worth fighting, especially when the enemy was inanimate footwear with a mysterious vendetta.

The first day of Japanese game show chaos had concluded, and against all odds, I was already anticipating the next one. If nothing else, it promised to be more interesting than watching Mrs. Kahale's cat pretend to be lost while conducting his feline romantic liaisons.

And if I was being completely honest—which I rarely was, even with myself—there was something oddly enjoyable about watching adults in sea creature costumes struggle through absurd challenges while a Japanese host shouted encouragement translated into existential poetry.

Not that I'd ever admit it to Madison. I had a reputation as a grumpy recluse to maintain, after all.

Even if that reputation was now in serious jeopardy, thanks to a manta ray with good observational skills and a talent for finding wayward flip-flops.
