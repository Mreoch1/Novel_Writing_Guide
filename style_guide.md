# Style Guide for Novel Writing

## Narrative Voice

### Formal vs. Informal
- **Formal Voice**:
  - Uses complex sentence structures
  - Avoids contractions and slang
  - Employs precise vocabulary
  - Creates distance between narrator and reader
  - Example: "The precipitation descended with considerable force."
- **Informal Voice**:
  - Uses contractions and casual language
  - Employs conversational tone
  - May include colloquialisms
  - Creates intimacy between narrator and reader
  - Example: "It was raining cats and dogs."

### Consistent Voice
- Maintain consistent level of formality throughout work
- Voice should match genre expectations:
  - Literary fiction: Often more formal
  - YA/Middle Grade: Often more informal
  - Genre fiction: Varies by subgenre

### First-Person Voice Considerations
- Should sound authentic to character's education/background
- Vocabulary limited to character's knowledge
- Cultural references limited to character's experience
- May evolve over time if character grows/changes

### Third-Person Voice Considerations
- Narrative distance: close (deep POV) vs. distant
- Vocabulary can exceed character's but should fit world/setting
- Balance between character's thoughts and narrator's observations

## Tone & Mood

### Tone
- **Author's attitude toward subject matter**:
  - Serious, humorous, ironic, satirical, reverent, etc.
  - Should remain consistent unless deliberate shift
  - Examples:
    - Irreverent: "Death had a busy schedule that Tuesday."
    - Serious: "The family gathered around the deathbed, grief etching lines on their faces."

### Mood
- **Emotional atmosphere created for reader**:
  - Tense, peaceful, melancholic, joyful, etc.
  - Created through setting, word choice, pacing
  - Can shift throughout narrative for emotional impact
  - Examples:
    - Suspenseful: "The floorboard creaked as she inched toward the door."
    - Romantic: "Sunset painted the sky in hues of amber and rose as they walked hand in hand."

### Establishing Mood Through:
1. **Setting details**: Weather, lighting, environment
2. **Sensory information**: Sounds, smells, textures
3. **Character reactions**: Physical responses to surroundings
4. **Pacing**: Sentence length and paragraph structure
5. **Word choice**: Connotations and associations

## Sentence Variety

### Length and Rhythm
- **Short sentences**:
  - Create urgency, tension
  - Emphasize important points
  - Example: "She ran. The door slammed. Someone screamed."
- **Long sentences**:
  - Create flow, contemplative mood
  - Connect complex ideas
  - Example: "The river wound through the valley, carving its ancient path between towering mountains that had stood sentinel since time immemorial, their peaks shrouded in mist and memory."
- **Mix lengths** for natural rhythm and emphasis

### Sentence Structure Variation
- **Simple**: One independent clause (Subject + Verb)
  - Example: "John opened the door."
- **Compound**: Two independent clauses joined by conjunction
  - Example: "John opened the door, and Mary entered the room."
- **Complex**: Independent clause + dependent clause
  - Example: "John opened the door when he heard the knock."
- **Compound-Complex**: Multiple independent clauses + dependent clause(s)
  - Example: "John opened the door when he heard the knock, but Mary had already left."

### Sentence Beginnings
- Vary opening words/phrases to avoid monotony
- Options include:
  - Prepositional phrases: "Under the stars, they made their vow."
  - Participial phrases: "Running through the rain, she reached the shelter."
  - Adverbial clauses: "Because he hesitated, the opportunity was lost."
  - Transitional words: "Meanwhile, the storm intensified."

## Metaphors & Similes

### Effective Usage
- Use sparingly for maximum impact
- Should illuminate, not obscure meaning
- Must be original and fresh, avoiding clichés
- Should relate to character/setting/theme

### Metaphors
- Implied comparison (X is Y)
- Example: "Her words were daggers."
- Creates direct association between concepts

### Similes
- Explicit comparison using "like" or "as"
- Example: "Her words cut like daggers."
- Creates more distance than metaphor

### Extended Metaphors
- Developed throughout paragraph or entire work
- Adds depth to theme or characterization
- Example: If life is a journey, describe obstacles as "mountains to climb," opportunities as "crossroads," etc.

### When to Avoid
- Action sequences (can slow pace)
- Dialogue (unless character would naturally speak this way)
- When clarity is paramount

## Descriptive Writing

### Sensory Details
- Engage all five senses, not just visual
- **Sight**: Colors, shapes, movements, light/shadow
- **Sound**: Volume, pitch, rhythm, silence
- **Touch**: Texture, temperature, pressure, pain/pleasure
- **Smell**: Pleasant/unpleasant, associations, intensity
- **Taste**: Sweet, sour, bitter, umami, combinations

### Visual Imagery
- Use specific, concrete details rather than generalities
- Weak: "The house was old."
- Strong: "Paint peeled from the weathered clapboards, and the once-white porch railings had yellowed to the color of aging bones."

### Strategic Description
- Focus on details that:
  - Advance plot or characterization
  - Establish mood
  - Reveal something important
- Avoid exhaustive cataloguing of every element

### Description Through Character Lens
- Filter details through character's perspective
- What would they notice first?
- How would their background affect what they observe?
- What emotional associations would certain details trigger?

## Dialogue Style

### Natural vs. Stylized
- **Natural dialogue**:
  - Includes hesitations, interruptions, incomplete thoughts
  - Features contractions, fragments, colloquialisms
  - Example: "Well, I... I'm not sure. Maybe we could—"
- **Stylized dialogue**:
  - More concise and purposeful than real speech
  - Eliminates mundane exchanges ("Hello," "How are you?")
  - Example: "Impossible. There must be another way."

### Character-Specific Speech Patterns
- Vocabulary choices reflect education, background, era
- Sentence structure reflects thinking patterns
- Speech tags and action beats reflect personality
- Consistent verbal tics or catchphrases (used sparingly)

### Subtext
- What characters don't say is often as important as what they do
- Create layers of meaning beneath surface conversation
- Example:
  - Text: "It's fine. Do whatever you want."
  - Subtext: Character is deeply hurt but suppressing feelings

### Internal Monologue
- Direct thought vs. indirect thought
- Length depends on character's introversion/analytical nature
- Should provide insights not available through dialogue or action
- Avoid redundancy with spoken dialogue

## Word Choice

### Precision
- Use specific words rather than general ones
- Weak: "She walked across the room."
- Strong: "She stumbled across the room."
- Strong: "She strutted across the room."
- Strong: "She shuffled across the room."

### Register and Diction
- **High register**: Formal, elaborate, academic
  - Example: "I request that you terminate this conversation."
- **Middle register**: Standard, mainstream, neutral
  - Example: "Please stop talking now."
- **Low register**: Informal, casual, colloquial
  - Example: "Shut up, will you?"

### Avoiding Clichés
- Replace worn phrases with fresh observations
- Cliché: "Her heart pounded like a drum."
- Fresh: "Her heart stuttered a panicked Morse code against her ribs."

### Regional Dialects and Slang
- Use sparingly to avoid caricature
- Focus on syntax and word choice rather than phonetic spelling
- Research thoroughly to avoid stereotyping
- Consider how much to include for readability

## Maintaining Consistency

### Style Sheets
- Create a document tracking:
  - Character-specific language patterns
  - Made-up terms and their usage
  - Recurring motifs or symbols
  - Punctuation decisions (e.g., use of em dashes, semicolons)

### Arc of Style
- Style may evolve throughout novel to reflect:
  - Character growth
  - Changing circumstances
  - Increasing tension
- Changes should be intentional and gradual

### Avoiding Style Inconsistencies
- Review for shifts in:
  - Formality level
  - Sentence complexity
  - Use of literary devices
  - Narrative distance
- Watch for sections written at different times or revised heavily
